(16, 1, 1, 'Ports and Port numbers', 'Ports', 'Learn about Ports and port numbers', '<p><strong>What is a port in networking?&nbsp;</strong><br />In the <a href="index/101">TCP</a> and <a href="javascript:article(106);" title="Basic Linux commands">UDP </a>protocols used in computer networking, a <strong>port</strong> is a special number present in the header of a data packet. Ports are typically used to map data to a particular process running on a computer. So-called "open ports" can be detected using port scanners like <a href="index/108">Nmap</a>. Leaving open ports in a network may be dangerous because the may be exploited by hackers.</p>\r\n<p>Ports can be readily explained with an analogy: think of IP addresses as the street address of an apartment building, and the port number as the number of a particular apartment within that building. If a letter (a <a href="index/101">data packet</a>) is sent to the apartment (IP) without an apartment number (port number) on it, then nobody knows who it is for (which service it is for). In order for the delivery to work, the sender needs to include an apartment number along with the address to ensure the letter gets to the right domicile.</p>\r\n<p>As an example, a server used for sending and receiving email may provide both an SMTP (for sending) and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POP3" title="POP3">POP3</a> (for receiving) service; these will be handled by different server processes, and the port number will be used to determine which data is associated with which process. By convention, the SMTP server will listen on port 25, while POP3 will listen on port 110, although it is possible to use different ports.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Which are the most important port numbers? </strong> <br />The port numbers are divided into three ranges. <br /><br /> * The Well Known Ports are those in the range 0&ndash;1023. On Unix-like operating systems, opening a port in this range to receive incoming connections requires <br />administrative privileges or possessing of CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability.<br /> * The Registered Ports are those in the range 1024&ndash;49151.<br /> * The Dynamic and/or Private Ports are those in the range 49152&ndash;65535.

Leaving open ports in a network may be dangerous because the may be exploited by hackers.</p>\r\n<p>Ports can be readily explained with an analogy: think of IP addresses as the street address of an apartment building, and the port number as the number of a particular apartment within that building. If a letter (a <a href="index/101">data packet</a>) is sent to the apartment (IP) without an apartment number (port number) on it, then nobody knows who it is for (which service it is for).

There are two computers involved in an FTP transfer: a server and a client. The FTP server, running FTP server software, listens on the network for connection requests from other computers. The client computer, running FTP client software, initiates a connection to the server. Once connected, the client can do a number of file manipulation operations such as uploading files to the server, download files from the server, rename or delete files on the server and so on. Any software company or individual programmer is able to create FTP server or client software because the protocol is an open standard. Virtually every computer platform supports the FTP protocol. This allows any computer connected to a TCP/IP based network to manipulate files on another computer on that network regardless of which operating systems are involved (if the computers permit FTP access). There are many existing FTP client and server programs. FTP servers can be set up anywhere between game servers, voice servers, internet hosts, and other physical servers.\r\n<br />\r\nFTP runs exclusively over TCP. FTP servers by default listen on port 21 for incoming connections from FTP clients. A connection to this port from the FTP Client forms the control stream on which commands are passed to the FTP server from the FTP client and on occasion from the FTP server to the FTP client. FTP uses out-of-band control, which means it uses a separate connection for control and data. Thus, for the actual file transfer to take place, a different connection is required which is called the data stream. Depending on the transfer mode, the process of setting up the data stream is different.\r\n<br />\r\nIn active mode, the FTP client opens a random port (> 1023), sends the FTP server the random port number on which it is listening over the control stream and waits for a connection from the FTP server. When the FTP server initiates the data connection to the FTP client it binds the source port to port 20 on the FTP server.\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to use active mode, the client sends a PORT command, with the IP and port as argument. The format for the IP and port is "h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2". Each field is a decimal representation of 8 bits of the host IP, followed by the chosen data port. For example, a client with an IP of 192.168.0.1, listening on port 1025 for the data connection will send the command "PORT 192,168,0,1,4,1". The port fields should be interpreted as p1?256 + p2 = port, or, in this example, 4?256 + 1 = 1025.\r\n<br />\r\nIn passive mode, the FTP server opens a random port (> 1023), sends the FTP client the server''s IP address to connect to and the port on which it is listening (a 16 bit value broken into a high and low byte, like explained before) over the control stream and waits for a connection from the FTP client. In this case the FTP client binds the source port of the connection to a random port greater than 1023.\r\n<br />\r\nTo use passive mode, the client sends the PASV command to which the server would reply with something similar to "227 Entering Passive Mode (127,0,0,1,78,52)". The syntax of the IP address and port are the same as for the argument to the PORT command.', '', 3, 2, 0, 0, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

', '<p><strong>What is SSH?&nbsp;</strong><br />Secure Shell or SSH is a network protocol that allows data to be exchanged over a secure channel between two computers. Encryption provides confidentiality and integrity of data. SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow the remote computer to authenticate the user, if necessary.<br /><br /> SSH is typically used to log into a remote machine and execute commands, but it also supports tunneling, forwarding arbitrary TCP ports and X11 connections; it can transfer files using the associated SFTP or SCP protocols. </p><p><strong> Basic Usage</strong><br /> ssh username@domain.com <br /><br /> An SSH server, by default, listens on the standard <a href="index/101"><strong>TCP</strong></a> <strong><a href="index/16">port</a> 22</strong>. An ssh client program is typically used for establishing connections to an sshd daemon accepting remote connections. Both are commonly present on most modern operating systems, including Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris and OpenVMS. Proprietary, freeware and open source versions of various levels of complexity and completeness exist. </p><p><br /><strong>When to use SSH&nbsp;</strong><br />* with an SSH client that supports terminal protocols, for remote administration of the SSH server computer via terminal (character-mode) console--can be used as an alternative to a terminal on a headless server;     </p><p>* In combination with SFTP, as a secure alternative to FTP which can be set up more easily on a small scale without a public key infrastructure and X.509 certificates;     </p><p>* in combination with rsync to backup, copy and mirror files efficiently and securely     </p><p>* in combination with SCP, as a secure alternative for rcp file transfers&mdash;more often used in environments involving Unix     </p><p>* for port forwarding or tunneling, frequently as an alternative to a full-fledged VPN. In this type of use, a (non-secure) TCP/IP connection of an external application is redirected to the SSH program (client or server), which forwards it to the other SSH party (server or client), which in turn forwards the connection to the desired destination host. The forwarded connection is encrypted and protected on the path between the SSH client and server only. Uses of SSH port forwarding include accessing database servers, email servers, securing X11, Windows Remote Desktop and VNC connections or even forwarding Windows file shares. This is primarily useful for tunneling connections through firewalls which would ordinarily block that type of connection, and for encrypting protocols which are not normally encrypted (e.g. VNC).     </p><p>* using just a normal ssh login on a server, the SSH Filesystem can securely mount a directory on the server as a filesystem on the local computer. </p><p><strong> Security cautions</strong><br />Since SSH-1 has inherent design flaws which make it vulnerable to, e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks, it is now generally considered obsolete and should be avoided by explicitly disabling fallback to SSH-1. While most modern servers and clients support SSH-2, some organizations still use software with no support for SSH-2, and thus SSH-1 cannot always be avoided.  In all versions of SSH, it is important to verify unknown public keys before accepting them as valid. Accepting an attacker''s public key as a valid public key has the effect of disclosing the transmitted password and allowing man in the middle attacks.  As with any encrypted protocol, SSH can be considered a security risk by companies or governments who do not trust their users and wish to eavesdrop on their communications. Furthermore SSH has built in tunneling features which make it easier for users to achieve passage of large volumes of information or to establish an entry point for unauthorized inward access over a SSH link than with other protocols. </p><p><br /><strong> SSH and public-key cryptography </strong><br /> First, a pair of cryptographic keys is generated. One is the private key, the other is the public key. As an analogy, they can be thought of as a matching private-key and a public padlock. The public padlock is what is installed on the remote machine and is used by ssh to authenticate users which use the matching private key. As a user of the system, you don&rsquo;t care who can see or copy the padlock (ie the public key), since only the secret private key fits it. The private key is the part you keep secret inside a secure box that can only be opened with the correct passphrase. When the user wants to access a remote system, he opens the secure box with his passphrase, and uses the private-key to authenticate him with the padlock on the remote computer. Neither the passphrase nor the private key leave the user''s machine. However, the user still needs to trust the local machine not to scrape his passphrase or copy his private-key while it''s out of the secure box. </p>', '', 2, 2, 0, 0, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

For example, a SQL based computer worm may port sweep looking for hosts listening on TCP/UDP port 1433.  </p><p><strong>What is Nmap? </strong><br />Nmap is a free security scanner written by Fyodor. It is used to evaluate the security of computers, and to discover services or servers on a computer network.  Nmap features include:      </p><p>* Host Discovery - Identifying computers on a network, for example listing the computers which respond to pings, or which have a particular port open</p><p>     * Port Scanning - Enumerating the open ports on one or more target computers     </p><p>* Version Detection - Interrogating listening network services listening on remote computers to determine the application name and version number. </p><p>* OS Detection - Remotely determining the operating system and some hardware characteristics of network devices.  </p><p>Typical uses of Nmap:      </p><p>* Auditing the security of a computer, by identifying the network connections which can be made to it </p><p>* Identifying open ports on a target computer in preparation for attacking it </p><p>* Network inventory, maintenance, and asset management     </p><p>* Auditing the security of a network, by identifying unexpected new servers </p><p><strong>Basic usage</strong>  </p><p>nmap -v scanme.nmap.org  </p><p>This option scans all reserved TCP ports on the machine scanme.nmap.org .

It was developed as part of the\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%20Systems%20Interconnection">Open Systems Interconnection</A> (OSI) initiative and is sometimes known as the\r\n  <STRONG>OSI seven layer model</STRONG>. From top to bottom, the OSI Model consists of the Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical layers.  A layer is a collection of related functions that provides services to the layer above it and receives service from the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that make up the contents of the path.

Not understanding that the pure seven-layer model is more historic than current, many beginners make the mistake of trying to fit every protocol they study into one of the seven basic layers.

Note carefully that this layer provides services to user-defined application processes, and not to the end user. For example, it defines a file transfer protocol, but the end user must go through an application process to invoke file transfer. The OSI model does not include human interfaces. The common application services sublayer provides functional elements including  the Remote Operations Service Element (comparable to Internet Remote Procedure Call), Association Control, and Transaction Processing (according to the\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</A> requirements). Above the common application service sublayer are functions meaningful to user application programs, such as messaging (X.400), directory (X.500), file transfer (FTAM), virtual terminal (VTAM), and batch job manipulation (JTAM).

The presentation service data units are then encapsulated into Session Protocol Data Units, and moved down the stack.    The original presentation structure used the Basic Encoding Rules of\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract%20Syntax%20Notation%20One">Abstract Syntax Notation One</A> (ASN.1), with capabilities such as  converting an\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC">EBCDIC</A> -coded text\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer%20file">file</A> to an\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</A> -coded file, or\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">serializing</A>\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/object%20%28computer%20science%29">objects</A> and other\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/data%20structure">data structures</A> into and out of\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</A>.

The OSI model made this layer responsible for "graceful close" of sessions, which is a property of\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission%20Control%20Protocol">TCP</A>, and also for session checkpointing and recovery, which is not usually used in the Internet protocols suite. Session layers are commonly used in application environments that make use of remote procedure calls (RPCs).\r\n</P>\r\n<H3>Layer 4: Transport layer</H3>\r\n<P> main | Transport layer The\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transport%20layer">transport layer</A> provides transparent transfer of\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/data">data</A> between end users, providing reliable data transfer services to the upper layers. The transport layer controls the reliability of a given link through flow control, segmentation/desegmentation, and error control. Some protocols are state and connection oriented. This means that the transport layer can keep track of the segments and retransmit those that fail.  Although it was not developed under the OSI Reference Model and does not strictly conform to the OSI definition of the Transport layer, the best known examples of a layer 4 protocol are the\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission%20Control%20Protocol">Transmission Control Protocol</A> (TCP) and\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%20Datagram%20Protocol">User Datagram Protocol</A> (UDP). Of the actual OSI protocols, there are five classes of transport protocols ranging from class 0 (which is also known as\r\n  <STRONG>TP0</STRONG> and provides the least error recovery) to class 4 (which is also known as\r\n  <STRONG>TP4</STRONG> and is designed for less reliable networks, similar to the Internet).  Class 0 is closest to UDP. Class 4 is closest to TCP, although TCP contains functions, such as the graceful close, which OSI assigns to the Session Layer.

Do remember, however, that a post office manages the outer envelope of mail. Higher layers may have the equivalent of double envelopes, such as cryptographic presentation services that can be read by the addressee only. Roughly speaking,\r\n  <EM> tunneling protocols\r\n  </EM> operate at the transport layer, such as carrying non-IP protocols such as\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM">IBM</A> ''s\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM%20Systems%20Network%20Architecture">SNA</A> or\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell">Novell</A> ''s\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetwork%20Packet%20Exchange">IPX</A> over an IP network, or end-to-end encryption with\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec">IPsec</A>. While\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic%20Routing%20Encapsulation">Generic Routing Encapsulation</A> (GRE) might seem to be a network layer protocol, if the encapsulation of the payload takes place only at endpoint, GRE becomes closer to a transport protocol that uses IP headers but contains complete frames or packets to deliver to an endpoint.\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer%202%20Tunneling%20Protocol">L2TP</A> carries\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point%20Protocol">PPP</A> frames inside transport packet.\r\n</P>\r\n<H3>Layer 3: Network layer</H3>\r\n<P> main | Network layer The\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/network%20layer">network layer</A> provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/data">data</A> sequences from a source to a destination via one or more networks, while maintaining the\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quality%20of%20service">quality of service</A> requested by the Transport layer. The Network layer performs network\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/routing">routing</A> functions, and might also perform fragmentation and reassembly, and report delivery errors.\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router">Routers</A> operate at this layerÃ¢â¬âsending data throughout the extended network and making the Internet possible. This is a logical addressing scheme Ã¢â¬â values are chosen by the network engineer. The addressing scheme is hierarchical. The best-known example of a layer 3 protocol is the\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20Protocol">Internet Protocol</A> (IP). It manages the\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionless%20protocol%20">connectionless</A> transfer of data one hop at a time, from end system to ingress router, to router to router, and from egress router to destination end system. It is not responsible for reliable delivery to a next hop, but only for the detection of errored packets so they may be discarded. When the medium of the next hop cannot accept a packet in its current length, IP is responsible for\r\n  <STRONG>fragmenting</STRONG> into sufficiently small packets that the medium can accept it. A number of layer management protocols, a function defined in the Management Annex, ISO 7498/4, belong to the network layer. These include routing protocols, multicast group management, network layer information and error, and network layer address assignment. It is the function of the payload that makes these belong to the network layer, not the protocol that carries them.\r\n</P>\r\n<H3>Layer 2: Data Link layer</H3>\r\n<P> main | Data link layer The\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/data%20link%20layer">data link layer</A> provides the functional and procedural means to transfer data between network entities and to detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the physical layer.  Originally, this layer was intended for point-to-point and point-to-multipoint media, characteristic of wide area media in the telephone system.  Local area network architecture, which included broadcast-capable multiaccess media, was developed independently of the ISO work, in\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE%20802%20">IEEE Project 802</A>.  IEEE work assumed sublayering and management functions not required for WAN use. In modern practice, only error detection, not flow control using sliding window, is present in modern data link protocols such as\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point%20Protocol">Point-to-Point Protocol</A> (PPP), and, on local area networks, the IEEE 802.2 LLC layer is not used for most protocols on Ethernet, and, on other local area networks, its flow control and acknowledgment mechanisms are rarely used. Sliding window flow control and acknowledgment is used at the transport layers by protocols such as\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission%20Control%20Protocol">TCP</A>, but is still used in niches where\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.25">X.25</A> offers performance advantages. Both WAN and LAN services arrange bits, from the physical layer, into logical sequences called frames.

To understand the function of the physical layer in contrast to the functions of the data link layer, think of the physical layer as concerned primarily with the interaction of a single device with a medium, where the data link layer is concerned more with the interactions of multiple devices (i.e., at least two) with a shared medium. The physical layer will tell one device how to transmit to the medium, and another device how to receive from it (in most cases it does not tell the device how to connect to the medium). Obsolescent physical layer standards such as\r\n  <A target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232">RS-232</A> do use physical wires to control access to the medium.

(123, 1, NULL, 'Honeypot', '', 'Learn more about honeypots.', '<P>This article is a copy from:\r\n<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</A>\r\n</P>\r\n<P>\r\nA <strong>honeypot</strong> is a trap set to detect, deflect, or in some manner counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. Generally it consists of  a\r\n<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computer">computer</a>, data, or a network site that appears to be part of a\r\n<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computer%20network">network</a> but which is actually isolated, (un)protected, and monitored, and which seems to contain information or a resource that would be of value to attackers. A honeypot that masquerades as an\r\n<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open%20proxy">open proxy</a> is known as a\r\n<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarcane%20%28computing%29">sugarcane</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Function </h2>\r\n<p> A honeypot is valuable as a surveillance and early-warning tool.  While it is often a computer, a honeypot can take on other forms, such as files or data records, or even unused\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP%20address">IP address</a> space.  Honeypots should have no production value and hence should not see any legitimate traffic or activity.  Whatever they capture can then be surmised as malicious or unauthorized.  One very practical implication of this is that honeypots designed to thwart\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam%20%28electronic%29">spam</a> by masquerading as systems of the types abused by spammers to send spam can categorize the material they trap 100% accurately: it is all illicit. Honeypots can carry risks to a network, and must be handled with care. If they are not properly walled off, an attacker can use them to break into a system.\r\n  <em> Victim hosts\r\n  </em> are an active network counter-intrusion tool. These computers run special software, designed to appear to an intruder as being important and worth looking into. In reality, these programs are dummies, and their patterns are constructed specifically to foster interest in attackers. The software installed on, and run by, victim hosts is dual purpose. First, these dummy programs keep a network intruder occupied looking for valuable information where none exists, effectively convincing him or her to isolate themselves in what is truly an unimportant part of the network. This decoy strategy is designed to keep an intruder from getting bored and heading into truly security-critical systems. The second part of the victim host strategy is intelligence gathering. Once an intruder has broken into the victim host, the machine or a network administrator can examine the intrusion methods used by the intruder. This intelligence can be used to build specific countermeasures to intrusion techniques, making truly important systems on the network less vulnerable to intrusion.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Types </h2>\r\n<p> Honeypots can be classified based on their deployment and based on their level of involvement. Based on the deployment, honeypots may be classified as:\r\n</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Production Honeypots</li>\r\n  <li>Research Honeypots</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n  <strong>Production honeypots</strong> are easy to use, capture only limited information, and are used primarily by companies or corporations; Production honeypots are placed inside the production network with other production servers by organization to improve their overall state of security. Normally, production honeypots are low-interaction honeypots which are easier to deploy. They give less information about the attacks or attackers than research honeypots do. The purpose of a production honeypot is to help mitigate risk in an organization. The honeypot adds value to the security measures of an organization.\r\n  <strong>Research honeypots</strong> are run by a volunteer, non-profit research organization or an educational institution to gather information about the motives and tactics of the\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%20hat">Blackhat</a> community targeting different networks. These honeypots do not add direct value to a specific organization. Instead they are used to research the threats organizations face, and to learn how to better protect against those threats. This information is then used to protect against those threats. Research honeypots are complex to deploy and maintain, capture extensive information, and are used primarily by research, military, or government organizations. Some variations of honeypots include the following:\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>honeyd (low-interaction)</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/honeyd">honeyd</a> is a\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU%20General%20Public%20License">GPL</a> licensed agent able to simulate big network structures on a single host. With one single instance of the agent, many different hosts running different services can be simulated. Services are customizable with userland scripts. Honeyd works by emulating computers on the unused IP address of a network.  It provides simple functionality by allowing scripts to simulate arbitrary services.  This gives an attacker a facade to attack, but usually does not allow full system compromise.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>mwcollect, nepenthes, honeytrap </h3>\r\n<p> mwcollect and nepenthes are both released under the\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU%20General%20Public%20License">GPL</a> license and can be used to collect autonomously spreading malware. Automated attacks are not only logged, the daemons extract information how to obtain the malware binaries from the exploit payload using known patterns and then actively download a sample. However, the whole exploitation process is simulated in a virtualized environment, so the honeypot can never be really infected with the Malware. honeytrap, also released under the\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU%20General%20Public%20License">GPL</a>, dynamically creates port listeners based on TCP connection attempts extracted from a network interface stream. This approach allows handling of some unknown attacks. Similar to nepenthes, malware downloads are performed by the software automatically. Incoming attacks can be mirrored back to the initiator.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Honeynet (high-interaction)</h3>\r\n<p> The Honeynet is a network of real systems. This network is reachable via the Honeywall gateway, a stealth inline network bridge that closely monitors and controls the network data flow to and from the honeypots in the network. Data capture includes network traffic captured on the honeywall gateway, system event data captured in logs, and keylog data gathered by a stealth keylogger on the honeypot systems.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Distributed systems</h3>\r\n<p> From the types of honeypots mentioned above, the information provided by high-interaction  honeypots has the highest fidelity. However, deploying a honeynet is not trivial.  Deployment must be done in a closely monitored environment. As a result, honeynets remain  concentrated in specific spots of the Internet and are susceptible to\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blacklist%20%28computing%29">blacklisting</a> by the attack tools. Another side effect of the honeynets being deployed as dispersed clusters  is that the data gathered by different honeynets cannot be easily correlated. Distributed honeypot systems aim to counter the above inefficiencies. The most common approach is deploying a cluster of high-interaction honeypots in a central location and dispersing lightweight traffic redirectors to sites across the Internet. With this technique, originally proposed by the Collapsar  project, the deployment costs are kept low, while blacklisting is made more difficult and the correlation of gathered data easier. The same technique is also employed by the Honey@Home tool which was developed in the context of the\r\n  <a href="http://www.fp6-noah.org/">NoAH project</a>. Honey@Home aims to capitalize on the rapid increase of residential\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband%20Internet%20access">broadband</a> subscribers and create a community-based network of distributed honeypot sensors.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Spam versions</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming">Spammers</a> are known to abuse vulnerable resources such as\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open%20mail%20relay">open mail relays</a> and\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open%20proxy">open proxies</a>. Some system administrators have created honeypot programs which masquerade as these abusable resources in order to discover the activities of spammers.  There are several capabilities such honeypots provide to these administrators and the existence of such fake abusable systems makes abuse more difficult or risky.  Honeypots can be a powerful countermeasure to the abuse from those who rely on very high volume abuse (e.g. spammers). The capabilities of value to the honeypot operator include determination of the apparent source (that is, IP address) of the abuse and bulk capture of spam (which makes possible determination of URLs and response mechanisms used by the spammers.)  For open relay honeypots it is possible to determine the e-mail addresses ("\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dropboxes">dropboxes</a> ") spammers use as targets for their test messages, which are the tool they use to detect open relays.  It is then simple to deceive the spammer: transmit any illicit relay e-mail received addressed to that dropbox e-mail address.  That would indicate to the spammer that the honeypot was a real abusable open relay and he would often respond by sending large quantities of relay spam to that honeypot, where it is stopped.  This was a capability of greatest value to the (unknown and unpredictable) intended recipients of the spam.   The apparent source may be another abused system: spammers and other abusers may use a chain of abused systems in order to make detection of the original starting point of the abuse traffic difficult.  This in itself is indicative of the power of honeypots as anti-spam tools: in the early days of anti-spam honeypot usage spammers showed little concern for hiding their location and would test for vulnerabilities and send spam directly from their own systems.  It was easy, it was safe.  Honeypots made the abuse less easy, less safe. Open relays are still used by spammers but the volume of spam sent through such open relays appears to be much smaller than it was in 2001 to 2002.  While most spam originates from within US, spammers do hop through open relays across political boundaries to mask their origin.  Honeypot operators may use intercepted relay tests to recognize and thwart attempts to relay spam through their honeypots.  "Thwart" may mean "accept the relay spam but decline to deliver it."  Honeypot operators may discover other details concerning the spam and the spammer by examining the captured spam messages.  (While the last sentence is written in present tense it may be that it should be in past tense - open relay spam has declined significantly.) Open relay honeypots include Jackpot,  written in\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java%20%28programming%20language%29">Java</a>, smtpot.py,  written in\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python%20%28programming%20language%29">Python</a>, and\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spamhole%20%28honeypot%29">spamhole (honeypot)</a>,  written in\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a>. The\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubblegum%20Proxypot">Bubblegum Proxypot</a> is an open proxy honeypot (or proxypot).\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>E-mail trap </h3>\r\n<p> An e-mail address that is not used for any other purpose than to receive spam can also be considered a spam honeypot. A better term might be\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spamtrap">spamtrap</a>, with the term "honeypot" reserved for systems and techniques used to detect or counter attacks and probes. Spam arrives at its destination "legitimately" - exactly as non-spam e-mail would arrive.  An amalgam of these techniques is\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project%20Honey%20Pot">Project Honey Pot</a>. The distributed, open source Project uses honeypot pages installed on websites around the world. These honeypot pages hand out uniquely tagged spamtrap e-mail addresses.\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail%20address%20harvesting">E-mail address harvesting</a> and\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spammers">Spammers</a> can then be tracked as they gather and subsequently send to these spamtrap e-mail addresses.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Detection </h2>\r\n<p> Just as honeypots are a weapon against spammers, honeypot detection systems are a spammer-employed counter-weapon. As detection systems would likely use unique characteristics of specific honeypots to identify, a plethora of honeypots in use makes the set of unique characteristics larger and more daunting to those seeking to detect and thereby identify them.  This is an unusual circumstance in software: a situation in which "versionitis" (a large number of versions of the same software, all differing slightly from each other) can be beneficial.  There''s also an advantage in having some easy-to-detect honeypots deployed.\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred%20Cohen">Fred Cohen</a>, the inventor of the\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception%20Toolkit">Deception Toolkit</a>, even argues that every system running his honeypot should have a deception port that adversaries can use to detect the honeypot. Cohen believes that this might deter adversaries.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Honeynets</h2>\r\n<p> Two or more honeypots on a network form a\r\n  <strong>honeynet</strong>. Typically, a honeynet is used for monitoring a larger and/or more diverse network in which one honeypot may not be sufficient. Honeynets and honeypots are usually implemented as parts of larger network\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intrusion-detection%20system">intrusion-detection systems</a>.

The name is derived from Greek chronos, meaning time. cron has been recreated several times in its history. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Design </h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  cron is driven by a \r\n  <em>\r\n    crontab\r\n  </em>, \r\n  <strong>a configuration</strong>\r\n  file that specifies \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix%20shell">shell</a>\r\n  commands to run periodically on a given schedule. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Usage </h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  Generally, the schedules modified by \r\n  <code>\r\n    crontab\r\n  </code>\r\n  are enacted by a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daemon%20%28computer%20software%29">daemon</a>, \r\n  <code>\r\n    crond\r\n  </code>, which runs constantly in the background and checks once a minute to see if any of the scheduled jobs need to be executed. If so, it executes them. These jobs are generally referred to as \r\n  <em>\r\n    cron jobs\r\n  </em>. A job is executed when the time/date specification fields \r\n  <em>\r\n    all\r\n  </em>\r\n  match the current time and date, with the exception that \r\n  <strong>either</strong>\r\n  the "day of month" field (3) \r\n  <strong>or</strong>\r\n  the "day of week" field (5) must match the current day, even though the other of the two fields doesn''t match the current day. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>crontab syntax </h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  The crontab files are stored where the lists of jobs and other instructions to the cron daemon are kept. Users can have their own individual crontab files and often there is a systemwide crontab file (usually in \r\n  <code>\r\n    /etc\r\n  </code>\r\n  or a subdirectory of \r\n  <code>\r\n    /etc\r\n  </code>\r\n  ) which is also used but can only be edited by the system administrator(s). Each line of a crontab file represents a job and follows a particular format as a series of fields, separated by spaces and/or tabs. Each field can have a single value or a series of values. \r\n</p>\r\n<h4>Operators </h4>\r\n<p>\r\n  There are several ways of specifying multiple \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/system%20time">date/time</a>\r\n  values in a field: \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>The comma ('','') operator specifies a list of values, for example: "1,3,4,7,8"</li>\r\n  <li>The dash (''-'') operator specifies a range of values, for example: "1-6", which is equivalent to "1,2,3,4,5,6"</li>\r\n  <li>The asterisk (''*'') operator specifies all possible values for a field. For example, an asterisk in the hour time field would be equivalent to ''every hour'' (subject to matching other specified fields).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n  There is also an operator which some extended versions of cron support, the slash (''/'') operator (called "step"), which can be used to skip a given number of values. For example, "*/3" in the hour time field is equivalent to "0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21". So "*" specifies ''every hour'' but the "/3" means only those hours divisible by 3. Example: the following will clear the apache error log at one minute past midnight each day. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  01 00 * * *  echo "" &gt; /www/apache/logs/error_log \r\n  </blockquote>\r\n  <h4>Fields </h4>\r\n  <p>\r\n  </p>\r\n<pre> <ol><li> +---------------- minute (0 - 59)</li><li> |  +------------- hour (0 - 23)</li><li> |  |  +---------- day of month (1 - 31)</li><li> |  |  |  +------- month (1 - 12)</li><li> |  |  |  |  +---- day of week (0 - 7) (Sunday=0 or 7)</li><li> |  |  |  |  |</li></ol><pre> *  *  *  *  *  command to be executed\r\n</pre>\r\n \r\n  </pre>\r\n  Each of the patterns from the first five fields may be either * (an asterisk), which matches all legal values, or a list of elements separated by commas.

This protocol reduces system administration workload, allowing devices to be added to the network with little or no manual configurations. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Applicability</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is  a way to manage network parameter assignment from a single DHCP server, or a group of DHCP servers arranged in a fault-tolerant manner. Even in small networks, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is useful because it can make it easy to add new machines to the local network.  \r\n</p>\r\n<pre>\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>\r\n  DHCP is also recommended even in the case of \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server%20%28computing%29">servers</a>\r\n  whose addresses rarely change, so that if a server needs to be readdressed (RFC2071), changes can be made in as few places as possible. For devices such as \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/router">routers</a>\r\n  and \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/firewall">firewalls</a>, that should not use DHCP, it can be useful to put \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial%20File%20Transfer%20Protocol">Trivial File Transfer Protocol</a>\r\n  (TFTP) or \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure%20Shell">SSH</a>\r\n  servers on the same machine that runs DHCP, which also serves to centralize administration. DHCP can be used to directly assign addresses to servers and desktop machines, and, through a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point%20Protocol">Point-to-Point Protocol</a>\r\n  (PPP) proxy, to dialup and broadband on-demand hosts, as well as for residential \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network%20address%20translation">Network address translation</a>\r\n  (NAT) \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway%20%28telecommunications%29">gateways</a>\r\n  and routers. DHCP is generally not appropriate for infrastructure such as non-edge routers and \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain%20name%20system">DNS</a>\r\n  servers. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  DHCP emerged as a standard protocol in October 1993 as defined in RFC 1531, succeeding the \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap%20Protocol">BOOTP</a>\r\n  protocol.  The next update, RFC 2131 released in 1997 is the current DHCP definition. The latest proposed standard for DHCP over IPv6 (\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCPv6">DHCPv6</a>\r\n  ) can be found in RFC 3315. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Basic protocol operation</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automates the assignment of IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateway, and other IP parameters.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n  When a DHCP-configured client (be it a computer or any other network-aware device) connects to a network, the DHCP client sends a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting%20%28computing%29">broadcast</a>\r\n  query requesting necessary information from a DHCP server. The DHCP server manages a pool of IP addresses and information about client configuration parameters such as the default gateway, the domain name, the DNS servers, other servers such as time servers, and so forth. Upon receipt of a valid request the server will assign the computer an IP address, a lease (the length of time for which the allocation is valid), and other IP configuration parameters, such as the \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subnet%20mask">subnet mask</a>\r\n  and the \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/default%20gateway">default gateway</a>. The query is typically initiated immediately after \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/booting">booting</a>\r\n  and must be completed before the client can initiate \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20Protocol">IP</a>\r\n  -based communication with other hosts.  DHCP provides three modes for allocating IP addresses. The best-known mode is \r\n  <strong>dynamic</strong>, in which the client is provided a "lease" on an IP address for a period of time. Depending on the stability of the network, this could range from hours (a wireless network at an airport) to months (for desktops in a wired lab). At any time before the lease expires, the DHCP client can request renewal of the lease on the current IP address. A properly-functioning client will use the renewal mechanism to maintain the same IP address throughout its connection to a single network, otherwise it may risk losing its lease while still connected, thus disrupting network connectivity while it renegotiates with the server for its original or a new IP address. The two other modes for allocation of IP addresses are \r\n  <strong>automatic</strong>\r\n  (also known as \r\n  <em>\r\n    DHCP Reservation\r\n  </em>\r\n  ), in which the address is permanently assigned to a client, and \r\n  <strong>manual</strong>, in which the address is selected by the client (manually by the user or any other means) and the DHCP protocol messages are used to inform the server that the address has been allocated. The automatic and manual methods are generally used when finer-grained control over IP address is required (typical of tight \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/firewall%20%28networking%29">firewall</a>\r\n  setups), although typically a firewall will allow access to the range of IP addresses that can be dynamically allocated by the DHCP server. The process of address allocation is known as ROSA.  R-Request, O-Offer, S-Send, A-Accept. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Security</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  Having been standardized before network security became a significant issue, the basic DHCP protocol includes no security features, and is potentially vulnerable to two types of attacks:  \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <strong>\r\n    <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue%20DHCP">Unauthorized DHCP Servers</a>\r\n    :</strong>\r\n  as you cannot specify the server you want, an unauthorized server can respond to client requests, sending client network configuration values that are beneficial to the attacker.  As an example, a hacker can hijack the DHCP process to configure clients to use a malicious \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain%20name%20system">DNS</a>\r\n  server or router (see also \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS%20cache%20poisoning">DNS cache poisoning</a>\r\n  ).</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <strong>Unauthorized DHCP Clients:</strong>\r\n  By \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack">masquerading</a>\r\n  as a legitimate client, an unauthorized client can gain access to network configuration and an IP address on a network it should otherwise not be allowed to use.  Also, by flooding the DHCP server with requests for IP addresses, it is possible for an attacker to exhaust the pool of available IP addresses, disrupting normal network activity (a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial_of_service_attack">denial of service attack</a>\r\n  ).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n  To combat these threats RFC 3118 ("Authentication for DHCP Messages") introduced authentication information into DHCP messages allowing clients and servers to reject information from invalid sources. Although support for this protocol is widespread, a large number of clients and servers still do not fully support authentication, thus forcing servers to support clients that do not support this feature.  As a result, other security measures are usually implemented around the DHCP server (such as \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec">IPsec</a>\r\n  ) to ensure that only authenticated clients and servers are granted access to the network. Wherever possible, DHCP-assigned addresses should be dynamically linked to a secure DNS server, to allow troubleshooting by name rather than by a potentially unknown address. Effective DHCP-DNS linkage requires having a file of either MAC addresses or local names that will be sent to DNS that uniquely identifies physical hosts, IP addresses, and other parameters such as the \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/default%20gateway">default gateway</a>, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork">subnet mask</a>, and IP addresses of \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain%20name%20system">DNS</a>\r\n  servers from a DHCP server. The DHCP server ensures that all IP addresses are unique, i.e., no IP address is assigned to a second client while the first client''s assignment is valid (its \r\n  <em>\r\n    lease\r\n  </em>\r\n  has not expired). Thus IP address pool management is done by the server and not by a network administrator.. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>IP address allocation</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  Depending on implementation, the DHCP server may have three methods of allocating IP-addresses, plus a fourth mode of operation ("manual") in which the client (rather than the DHCP server) assigns an IP address.  (WARNING--the terminology below differs from the terminology above in \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Basic_Protocol_Operation">Basic Control Operation</a>\r\n  ): \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <strong>dynamic allocation</strong>\r\n  : A \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/network%20administrator">network administrator</a>\r\n  assigns a range of IP addresses to DHCP, and each client computer on the LAN has its \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20Protocol">IP</a>\r\n  software configured to request an IP address from the DHCP \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server%20%28computing%29">server</a>\r\n  during network initialization. The request-and-grant process uses a lease concept with a controllable time period, allowing the DHCP server to reclaim (and then reallocate) IP addresses that are not renewed (dynamic re-use of IP addresses).</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <strong>automatic allocation</strong>\r\n  : The DHCP server permanently assigns a free IP address to a requesting client from the range defined by the administrator.  This is like dynamic allocation, but the DHCP server keeps a table of past IP address assignments, so that it can preferentially assign to a client the same IP address that the client previously had.</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <strong>static allocation</strong>\r\n  : The DHCP server allocates an IP address based on a table with \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC%20address">MAC address</a>\r\n  /\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP%20address">IP address</a>\r\n  pairs, which are manually filled in (perhaps by a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/network%20administrator">network administrator</a>\r\n  ). Only requesting clients with a MAC address listed in this table will be allocated an IP address.  This feature (which is not supported by all routers) is variously called "\r\n  <strong>Static DHCP Assignment</strong>\r\n  " (by \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DD-WRT">DD-WRT</a>\r\n  ), "\r\n  <strong>fixed-address</strong>\r\n  " (by the dhcpd documentation), "\r\n  <strong>DHCP reservation</strong>\r\n  " or "\r\n  <strong>Static DHCP</strong>\r\n  " (by Cisco/\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys">Linksys</a>\r\n  ), and "\r\n  <strong>IP reservation</strong>\r\n  " or "\r\n  <strong>MAC/IP binding</strong>\r\n  " (by various other router manufacturers).</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <strong>manual allocation</strong>\r\n  : The DHCP server does not assign the IP address; instead, the client is configured with a user-specified static IP address.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n  Many DHCP servers can manage hosts by more than one of the above methods.  For example, the known hosts on the network can be assigned an IP address based on their MAC address (static allocation) whereas "guest" computers (such as laptops via WiFi) are allocated a temporary IP address out of a pool compatible with the network to which they''re attached (dynamic allocation). \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>DHCP and firewalls </h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall%20%28networking%29">Firewalls</a>\r\n  usually have to permit DHCP traffic explicitly. Specification of the DHCP client-server protocol describes several cases when packets must have the source address of \r\n  <tt>\r\n    0x00000000\r\n  </tt>\r\n  or the destination address of \r\n  <tt>\r\n    0xffffffff\r\n  </tt>. Anti-\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spoofing%20attack">spoofing</a>\r\n  policy rules and tight inclusive firewalls often stop such packets. \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-homed">Multi-homed</a>\r\n  DHCP servers require special consideration and further complicate configuration. To allow DHCP, network administrators need to allow several types of packets through the server-side firewall. All DHCP packets travel as \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%20Datagram%20Protocol">UDP</a>\r\n  datagrams; all client-sent packets have source port 68 and destination port 67; all server-sent packets have source port 67 and destination port 68. For example, a server-side firewall should allow the following types of packets: \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Incoming packets from 0.0.0.0 or dhcp-pool to dhcp-ip</li>\r\n  <li>Incoming packets from any address to 255.255.255.255</li>\r\n  <li>Outgoing packets from dhcp-ip to dhcp-pool or 255.255.255.255</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n  where \r\n  <em>\r\n    dhcp-ip\r\n  </em>\r\n  represents any address configured on a DHCP server host and \r\n  <em>\r\n    dhcp-pool\r\n  </em>\r\n  stands for the pool from which a DHCP server assigns addresses to clients \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Example in ipfw firewall</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  To give an idea of how a configuration would look in production, the following rules for a server-side \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ipfirewall">ipfirewall</a>\r\n  to allow DHCP traffic through.

It makes use of a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trusted%20third%20party">trusted third party</a>, termed a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/key%20distribution%20center">key distribution center</a>\r\n  (KDC), which consists of two logically separate parts: an Authentication Server (AS) and a Ticket Granting Server (TGS). Kerberos works on the basis of "tickets" which serve to prove the identity of users. The KDC maintains a database of secret keys; each entity on the network Ã¢â¬â whether a client or a server Ã¢â¬â shares a secret key known only to itself and to the KDC. Knowledge of this key serves to prove an entity''s identity. For communication between two entities, the KDC generates a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/session%20key">session key</a>\r\n  which they can use to secure their interactions. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Protocol</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  The \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/security">security</a>\r\n  of the protocol relies heavily on  participants maintaining loosely synchronized time and on short-lived assertions of authenticity called \r\n  <em>\r\n    Kerberos tickets\r\n  </em>. What follows is a simplified description of the protocol. The following abbreviations will be used: \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>AS = Authentication Server</li>\r\n  <li>TGS = Ticket Granting Server</li>\r\n  <li>SS = Service Server</li>\r\n  <li>TGT = Ticket Granting Ticket</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n  Briefly, the client authenticates to AS  using a long-term \r\n  <em>\r\n    <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shared%20secret">shared secret</a>\r\n  </em>\r\n  and receives a ticket \r\n  <strong>from</strong>\r\n  the AS.  Later the client can use this ticket to get additional tickets for SS without resorting to using the shared secret.  These tickets can be used to prove authentication to SS. In more detail: User Client-based Logon Steps: \r\n</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>A user enters a username and password on the \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/client%20%28computing%29">client machine</a>.</li>\r\n  <li>The client performs a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/one-way%20function">one-way function</a>\r\n  (Hash mostly) on the entered password, and this becomes the secret key of the client.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n  Client Authentication Steps: \r\n</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>The client sends a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cleartext">cleartext</a>\r\n  message to the AS requesting services on behalf of the user. Sample message: "User XYZ would like to request services". Note: Neither the secret key nor the password is sent to the AS.</li>\r\n  <li>The AS checks to see if the client is in its database. If it is, the AS sends back the following two messages to the client:\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Message A: \r\n    <em>\r\n      Client/TGS Session Key\r\n    </em>\r\n    encrypted using the secret key of the user.</li>\r\n    <li>Message B: \r\n    <em>\r\n      Ticket-Granting Ticket\r\n    </em>\r\n    (which includes the client ID, client network address, ticket validity period, and the \r\n    <em>\r\n      client/TGS session key\r\n    </em>\r\n    ) encrypted using the secret key of the TGS.</li>\r\n  </ul></li>\r\n  <li>Once the client receives messages A and B, it decrypts message A to obtain the \r\n  <em>\r\n    Client/TGS Session Key\r\n  </em>. This session key is used for further communications with TGS. (Note: The client cannot decrypt Message B, as it is encrypted using TGS''s secret key.)  At this point, the client has enough information to authenticate itself to the TGS.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n  Client Service Authorization Steps: \r\n</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>When requesting services, the client sends the following two messages to the TGS:\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Message C: Composed of the \r\n    <em>\r\n      Ticket-Granting Ticket\r\n    </em>\r\n    from message B and the ID of the requested service.</li>\r\n    <li>Message D: Authenticator (which is composed of the client ID and the timestamp), encrypted using the \r\n    <em>\r\n      Client/TGS Session Key\r\n    </em>.</li>\r\n  </ul></li>\r\n  <li>Upon receiving messages C and D, the TGS retrieves message B out of message C. It decrypts message B using the TGS secret key. This gives it the "client/TGS session key". Using this key, the TGS decrypts message D (Authenticator) and sends the following two messages to the client:\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Message E: \r\n    <em>\r\n      Client-to-server ticket\r\n    </em>\r\n    (which includes the client ID, client network address, validity period and \r\n    <em>\r\n      Client/Server Session Key\r\n    </em>\r\n    ) encrypted using the service''s secret key.</li>\r\n    <li>Message F: \r\n    <em>\r\n      Client/server session key\r\n    </em>\r\n    encrypted with the \r\n    <em>\r\n      Client/TGS Session Key\r\n    </em>.</li>\r\n  </ul></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n  Client Service Request Steps: \r\n</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Upon receiving messages E and F from TGS, the client has enough information to authenticate itself to the SS.  The client connects to the SS and sends the following two messages:\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Message E from the previous step (the \r\n    <em>\r\n      client-to-server ticket\r\n    </em>, encrypted using service''s secret key).</li>\r\n    <li>Message G: a new Authenticator, which includes the client ID, timestamp and is encrypted using \r\n    <em>\r\n      client/server session key\r\n    </em>.</li>\r\n  </ul></li>\r\n  <li>The SS decrypts the ticket using its own secret key to retrieve the \r\n  <em>\r\n    Client/Server Session Key\r\n  </em>. Using the sessions key, SS decrypts the Authenticator and sends the following message to the client to confirm its true identity and willingness to serve the client:\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Message H: the timestamp found in client''s Authenticator plus 1, encrypted using the \r\n    <em>\r\n      Client/Server Session Key\r\n    </em>.</li>\r\n  </ul></li>\r\n  <li>The client decrypts the confirmation using the \r\n  <em>\r\n    Client/Server Session Key\r\n  </em>\r\n  and checks whether the timestamp is correctly updated. If so, then the client can trust the server and can start issuing service requests to the server.</li>\r\n  <li>The server provides the requested services to the client.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Drawbacks </h2>\r\n<p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Single point of failure: It requires continuous availability of a central server. When the Kerberos server is down, no one can log in. This can be mitigated by using multiple Kerberos servers.</li>\r\n  <li>Kerberos requires the clocks of the involved hosts to be synchronized. The tickets have time availability period and, if the host clock is not synchronized with the clock of Kerberos server, the authentication will fail. The default configuration requires that clock times are no more than 10 minutes apart.  In practice, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network%20Time%20Protocol">Network Time Protocol</a>\r\n  daemons are usually used to keep the host clocks synchronized.</li>\r\n  <li>The administration protocol is not standardized, and differs between server implementations.

The user or machine sends a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network%20Access%20Server">Network Access Server</a>\r\n  (NAS) a request for access to a particular network resource using access credentials. The credentials are passed to the NAS device via the link-layer protocol - for example, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point%20Protocol">Point-to-Point Protocol</a>\r\n  (PPP) in the case of many dialup or DSL providers. In turn, the NAS sends a RADIUS \r\n  <em>\r\n    Access Request\r\n  </em>\r\n  message to the RADIUS server, requesting authorization to grant access via the RADIUS protocol. This request includes access credentials, typically in the form of \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/username">username</a>\r\n  and \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/password">password</a>\r\n  or security certificate provided by the user.  Additionally, the request contains information which the NAS knows about the user, such as its network address or phone number, and information regarding the user''s physical point of attachment to the NAS. The RADIUS server checks that the information is correct using authentication schemes like \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password%20authentication%20protocol">PAP</a>, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-handshake%20authentication%20protocol">CHAP</a>\r\n  or \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible%20Authentication%20Protocol">EAP</a>. The user''s proof of identification is verified, along with, optionally, other information related to the request, such as the user''s network address or phone number, account status and specific network service access privileges. Historically, RADIUS servers checked the user''s information against a locally stored flat file database.  Modern RADIUS servers can do this, or can refer to external sources - commonly \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos%20%28protocol%29">Kerberos</a>, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP">LDAP</a>, or \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active%20Directory">Active Directory</a>\r\n  servers - to verify the user''s credentials. The RADIUS server then returns one of three responses to the NAS; a "Nay" (Access Reject), "Challenge" (Access Challenge) or "Yea" (Access Accept). \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <em>\r\n    Access Reject\r\n  </em>\r\n  - The user is unconditionally denied access to all requested network resources. Reasons may include failure to provide proof of identification or an unknown or inactive user account.</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <em>\r\n    Access Challenge\r\n  </em>\r\n  - Requests additional information from the user such as a secondary password, PIN, token or card. Access Challenge is also used in more complex authentication dialogs where a secure tunnel is established between the user machine and the Radius Server in  a way that the access credentials are hidden from the NAS.</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <em>\r\n    Access Accept\r\n  </em>\r\n  - The user is granted access. Once the user is authenticated, the RADIUS server will often check that the user is authorized to use the network service requested.  A given user may be allowed to use a company''s wireless network, but not its VPN service, for example. Again, this information may be stored locally on the RADIUS server, or may be looked up in an external source like LDAP or Active Directory.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n  Authorization attributes are conveyed to the NAS stipulating terms of access to be granted. For example: the following authorisation attributes may be included in an Access-Accept. \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>The specific \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP%20address">IP address</a>\r\n  to be assigned to the user</li>\r\n  <li>The address pool from which the user''s IP should be chosen</li>\r\n  <li>The maximum length that the user may remain connected</li>\r\n  <li>An access list, priority queue or other restrictions on a user''s access</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L2TP">L2TP</a>\r\n  parameters</li>\r\n  <li>VLAN parameters</li>\r\n  <li>Quality of Service (QoS) parameters</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Accounting</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  Accounting is described in RFC 2866. \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>When network access is granted to the user by the NAS, an \r\n  <em>\r\n    Accounting Start\r\n  </em>\r\n  request is sent by the NAS to the RADIUS server to signal the start of the user''s network access.

A directory is a set of objects with similar attributes organized in a logical and hierarchical manner. The most common example is the telephone directory, which consists of a series of names (either of persons or organizations) organized alphabetically, with each name having an address and phone number attached. Due to this basic design (among other factors) LDAP is often used by other services for authentication, despite the security problems this causes. An \r\n<a href="/wiki/Directory%20Information%20Tree">LDAP directory tree</a>\r\noften reflects various political, geographic, and/or organizational boundaries, depending on the model chosen.  LDAP deployments today tend to use \r\n<a href="/wiki/Domain%20name%20system">Domain name system</a>\r\n(DNS)  names for structuring the topmost levels of the hierarchy.  Deeper inside the directory might appear entries representing people, organizational units, printers, documents, groups of people or anything else that represents a given tree entry (or multiple entries). Its current version is LDAPv3, which is specified in a series of \r\n<a href="/wiki/Internet%20Engineering%20Task%20Force">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>\r\n(IETF) Standard Track \r\n<a href="/wiki/Request%20for%20Comments">Requests for comments</a>\r\n(RFCs) as detailed in RFC 4510. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Protocol overview</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  A client starts an LDAP session by connecting to an LDAP server, by default on \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission%20Control%20Protocol">TCP</a>\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP%20and%20UDP%20port">port</a>\r\n  389. The client then sends an operation request to the server, and the server sends responses in turn. With some exceptions, the client need not wait for a response before sending the next request, and the server may send the responses in any order. The client may request the following operations: \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Bind - \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication">authenticate</a>\r\n  and specify LDAP protocol version</li>\r\n  <li>Start TLS - use the LDAPv3 \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport%20Layer%20Security">Transport Layer Security</a>\r\n  (TLS) extension for a secure connection</li>\r\n  <li>Search - search for and/or retrieve directory entries</li>\r\n  <li>Compare - test if a named entry contains a given attribute value</li>\r\n  <li>Add a new entry</li>\r\n  <li>Delete an entry</li>\r\n  <li>Modify an entry</li>\r\n  <li>Modify Distinguished Name (DN) - move or rename an entry</li>\r\n  <li>Abandon - abort a previous request</li>\r\n  <li>Extended Operation - generic operation used to define other operations</li>\r\n  <li>Unbind - close the connection (not the inverse of Bind) </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n  In addition the server may send "Unsolicited Notifications" that are not responses to any request, e.g. before it times out a connection. A common alternate method of securing LDAP communication is using an \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure%20Socket%20Layer%20Tunnel">SSL tunnel</a>. This is denoted in LDAP URLs by using the URL scheme "ldaps". The default port for LDAP over \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure%20Socket%20Layer">SSL</a>\r\n  is 636. The use of LDAP over SSL was common in LDAP Version 2 (LDAPv2) but it was never standardized in any formal specification. This usage has been deprecated along with LDAPv2, which was officially \r\n  <a href="http://www.ietf.org/IESG/Announcements/draft-zeilenga-ldapv2.ann">retired in 2003</a>. LDAP is defined in terms of \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract%20syntax%20notation%20one">ASN.1</a>, and protocol messages are encoded in the binary format \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic%20encoding%20rules">BER</a>.  It uses textual representations for a number of ASN.1 fields/types, however. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Directory structure</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  The protocol accesses LDAP directories, which follow the 1993 edition of the \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.500">X.500</a>\r\n  model: \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>A directory is a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory%20Information%20Tree">tree of directory entries</a>.</li>\r\n  <li>An entry consists of a set of attributes.</li>\r\n  <li>An attribute has a name (an \r\n  <em>\r\n    attribute type\r\n  </em>\r\n  or \r\n  <em>\r\n    attribute description\r\n  </em>\r\n  ) and one or more values.  The attributes are defined in a \r\n  <em>\r\n    schema\r\n  </em>\r\n  (see below).</li>\r\n  <li>Each entry has a unique identifier: its \r\n  <em>\r\n    Distinguished Name\r\n  </em>\r\n  (DN).  This consists of its \r\n  <em>\r\n    Relative Distinguished Name\r\n  </em>\r\n  (RDN) constructed from some attribute(s) in the entry, followed by the parent entry''s DN.  Think of the DN as a full filename and the RDN as a relative filename in a folder.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n  Be aware that a DN may change over the lifetime of the entry, for instance, when entries are moved  within a tree. To reliably and unambiguously identify entries, a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUID">UUID</a>\r\n  might be provided in the set of the entry''s \r\n  <em>\r\n    operational attributes\r\n  </em>. An entry can look like this when represented in \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP%20Data%20Interchange%20Format">LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF)</a>\r\n  (LDAP itself is a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/binary%20protocol">binary protocol</a>\r\n  ): \r\n</p>\r\n<pre> dn: cn=John Doe,dc=example,dc=com\r\ncn: John Doe\r\ngivenName: John\r\nsn: Doe\r\ntelephoneNumber: +1 888 555 6789\r\ntelephoneNumber: +1 888 555 1232\r\nmail: john@example.com\r\nmanager: cn=Barbara Doe,dc=example,dc=com\r\nobjectClass: inetOrgPerson\r\nobjectClass: organizationalPerson\r\nobjectClass: person\r\nobjectClass: top\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>\r\n  dn is the name of the entry; it''s not an attribute nor part of the entry.  "cn=John Doe" is the entry''s RDN, and "dc=example,dc=com" is the DN of the parent entry, where dc denotes Domain Component.  The other lines show the attributes in the entry.  Attribute names are typically mnemonic strings, like "cn" for common name, "dc" for domain component, "mail" for e-mail address and "sn" for surname. A server holds a subtree starting from a specific entry, e.g. "dc=example,dc=com" and its children.  Servers may also hold references to other servers, so an attempt to access "ou=department,dc=example,dc=com" could return a \r\n  <em>\r\n    referral\r\n  </em>\r\n  or \r\n  <em>\r\n    continuation reference\r\n  </em>\r\n  to a server which holds that part of the directory tree.  The client can then contact the other server.  Some servers also support \r\n  <em>\r\n    chaining\r\n  </em>, which means the server contacts the other server and returns the results to the client. LDAP rarely defines any ordering: The server may return the values in an attribute, the attributes in an entry, and the entries found by a search operation in any order. This follows from the formal definitions - an entry is defined as a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/set">set</a>\r\n  of attributes, and an attribute is a set of values, and sets need not be ordered. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Operations</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  The client gives each request a positive Message ID, and the server response has the same Message ID.  The response includes a numeric result code which indicates success, some error condition or some other special cases.  Before the response, the server may send other messages with other result data - for example each entry found by the Search operation is returned in such a message. \r\n</p>\r\n<dl>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <em>\r\n      Expand discussion of referral responses to various operations, especially modify, for example where all modifies must be directed from replicas to a master directory.\r\n    </em>\r\n  </dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n<h3>StartTLS</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  The StartTLS operation establishes \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport%20Layer%20Security">Transport Layer Security</a>\r\n  (the descendant of \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport%20Layer%20Security">SSL</a>\r\n  ) on the connection.  That can provide data confidentiality (cannot be read by third parties) and/or data integrity protection (protect from tampering).  During TLS negotiation the server sends its \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a>\r\n  certificate to prove its identity.  The client may also send a certificate to prove its identity.  After doing so, the client may then use \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple%20Authentication%20and%20Security%20Layer">SASL</a>\r\n  /EXTERNAL to have this identity used in determining the identity used in making LDAP authorization decisions. Servers also often support the non-standard "LDAPS" ("Secure LDAP", commonly known as "LDAP over SSL") protocol on a separate port, by default 636.  LDAPS differs from LDAP in two ways: 1) upon connect, the client and server establish TLS before any LDAP messages are transferred (without a Start TLS operation) and 2) the LDAPS connection must be closed upon TLS closure. LDAPS was primarily used with LDAPv2, because the StartTLS operation had not yet been defined. The use of LDAPS is deprecated, and modern software should only use StartTLS. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Bind (authenticate)</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  The Bind operation authenticates the client to the server. Simple Bind can send the user''s DN and password in \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plaintext">plaintext</a>, so the connection should be protected using \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport%20Layer%20Security">Transport Layer Security</a>\r\n  (TLS). The server typically checks the password against the userPassword attribute in the named entry.  Anonymous Bind (with empty DN and password) resets the connection to anonymous state. \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple%20Authentication%20and%20Security%20Layer">SASL</a>\r\n  (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) Bind provides authentication services through a wide range of mechanisms, e.g. \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos%20%28protocol%29">Kerberos</a>\r\n  or the client certificate sent with TLS.   Bind also sets the LDAP protocol version. Normally clients should use LDAPv3, which is the default in the protocol but not always in LDAP libraries. Bind had to be the first operation in a session in LDAPv2, but is not required in LDAPv3 (the current LDAP version). \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Search and Compare</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  The Search operation is used to both search for and read entries.  Its parameters are: \r\n</p>\r\n<dl>\r\n  <dt>\r\n    baseObject\r\n  </dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    The DN (Distinguished Name) of the entry at which to start the search,\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>\r\n    scope\r\n  </dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    BaseObject (search just the named entry, typically used to read one entry), singleLevel (entries immediately below the base DN), or wholeSubtree (the entire subtree starting at the base DN).\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>\r\n    filter\r\n  </dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    How to examine each entry in the scope.  E.g. (&amp;(objectClass=person)(|(givenName=John)(mail=john*))) - search for persons who either have given name John or an e-mail address starting with john.\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>\r\n    derefAliases\r\n  </dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    Whether and how to follow alias entries (entries which refer to other entries),\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>\r\n    attributes\r\n  </dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    Which attributes to return in result entries.\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>\r\n    sizeLimit, timeLimit\r\n  </dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    Max number of entries, and max search time.\r\n  </dd>\r\n  <dt>\r\n    typesOnly\r\n  </dt>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    Return attribute types only, not attribute values.\r\n  </dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n<p>\r\n  The server returns the matching entries and maybe continuation references (in any order), followed by the final result with the result code. The Compare operation takes a DN, an attribute name and an attribute value, and checks if the named entry contains that attribute with that value. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Update Data</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  Add, Delete, and Modify DN - all require the DN of the entry that is to be changed. Modify takes a list of attributes to modify and the modifications to each: Delete the attribute or some values, add new values, or replace the current values with the new ones. Add operations also can have additional attributes and values for those attributes. Modify DN (move/rename entry) takes the new RDN (Relative Distinguished Name), optionally the new parent''s DN, and a flag which says whether to delete the value(s) in the entry which match the old RDN.  The server may support renaming of entire directory subtrees. An update operation is atomic: Other operations will see either the new entry or the old one.  On the other hand, LDAP does not define transactions of multiple operations: If you read an entry and then modify it, another client may have updated the entry in the mean time.  Servers may implement extensions which support this, however. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Extended operations</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  The Extended Operation is a generic LDAP operation which can be used to define new operations.  Examples include the Cancel, Password Modify and Start TLS operations. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Abandon</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  The Abandon operation requests that the server aborts an operation named by a message ID.  The server need not honor the request.  Unfortunately, neither Abandon nor a successfully abandoned operation send a response.  A similar Cancel extended operation has therefore been defined which does send responses, but not all implementations support this. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Unbind</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  The Unbind operation abandons any outstanding operations and closes the connection.  It has no response.  The name is of historical origin:  It is \r\n  <em>\r\n    not\r\n  </em>\r\n  the opposite of the Bind operation. Clients can abort a session by simply closing the connection, but they should use Unbind.  Otherwise the server cannot tell the difference between a failed network connection (or a truncation attack) and a discourteous client. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>LDAP URLs</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  An LDAP \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform%20Resource%20Locator">URL</a>\r\n  format exists which clients support in varying degree, and which servers return in referrals and continuation references (see RFC 4516): \r\n</p>\r\n<pre>ldap://host:port/DN?attributes?scope?filter?extensions\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>\r\n  Most of the components, which are described below, are optional. \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <em>\r\n    host\r\n  </em>\r\n  is the DNS or IP address of the LDAP server to search.</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <em>\r\n    port\r\n  </em>\r\n  is the \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/network%20port">network port</a>\r\n  of the LDAP server.</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <em>\r\n    DN\r\n  </em>\r\n  is the distinguished name to use as the search base.</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <em>\r\n    attributes\r\n  </em>\r\n  is a comma-separated list of attributes to retrieve.</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <em>\r\n    scope\r\n  </em>\r\n  specifies the search scope and can be "base" (the default), "one" or "sub".</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <em>\r\n    filter\r\n  </em>\r\n  is a search filter, e.g. \r\n  <code>\r\n    (objectClass=*)\r\n  </code>\r\n  (see RFC 4515).</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <em>\r\n    extensions\r\n  </em>\r\n  are extensions to the LDAP URL format.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n  For example, "\r\n  <code>\r\n    ldap://ldap.example.com/cn=John%20Doe,dc=example,dc=com\r\n  </code>\r\n  " refers to all user attributes in John Doe''s entry in \r\n  <code>\r\n    ldap.example.com\r\n  </code>, while "\r\n  <code>\r\n    ldap:///dc=example,dc=com??sub?(givenName=John)\r\n  </code>\r\n  " searches for the entry in the default server.  As in other URLs, special characters must be \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/percent-encoding">percent-encoded</a>. There is a similar non-standard "ldaps:" URL scheme for LDAP over SSL. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Schema</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  The contents of the entries in a subtree are governed by a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/logical%20schema">schema</a>. The schema defines the \r\n  <em>\r\n    attribute types\r\n  </em>\r\n  that directory entries can contain. An attribute definition includes a \r\n  <em>\r\n    syntax\r\n  </em>, and most non-binary values in LDAPv3 use \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>\r\n  string syntax. For example, a "mail" attribute might contain the value "user@example.com". A "jpegPhoto" attribute would contain photograph(s) in binary \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JPEG</a>\r\n  /JFIF format.  A "member" attribute contains DNs of other directory entries. Attribute definitions also specify whether the attribute is single-valued or multi-valued, how to search/compare the attribute (e.g. case-sensitive vs. case-insensitive and whether substring matching is supported), etc. The schema defines \r\n  <em>\r\n    object classes\r\n  </em>.  Each entry must have an objectClass attribute, containing named classes defined in the schema.  The schema definition of the classes of an entry defines what kind of object the entry may represent - e.g. a person, organization or domain.  The object class definitions also list which attributes are obligatory and which are optional. For example, an entry representing a person might belong to the classes "top" and "person". Membership in the "person" class would require the entry to contain the "sn" and "cn" attributes, and allow the entry also to contain "userPassword", "telephoneNumber", and other attributes. Since entries may belong to multiple classes, each entry has a complex of optional and mandatory attribute sets formed from the union of the object classes it represents. ObjectClasses can be inherited, and a single entry can have multiple objectClasses to define the available and required attributes of the entry itself. A parallel to the schema of an objectClass is a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class%20%28computer%20science%29">class</a>\r\n  definition and an \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instantiation%20%28computer%20science%29">instance</a>\r\n  in \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented%20programming">Object-oriented programming</a>, representing LDAP objectClass and LDAP entry, respectively. The schema also includes various other information controlling directory entries. Most schema elements have a name and a globally unique \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%20identifier">Object identifier</a>\r\n  (OID). Directory servers may publish the directory schema controlling an entry at a base DN given by the entry''s subschemaSubentry operational attribute.  (An \r\n  <em>\r\n    operational attribute\r\n  </em>\r\n  describes operation of the directory rather than user information and is only returned from a search when it is explicitly requested.) Server administrators can define their own schemas in addition to the standard ones.  A schema for representing individual people within organizations is termed a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white%20pages%20schema">white pages schema</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Variations</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  A lot of the server operation is left to the implementor or administrator to decide.  Accordingly, servers may be set up to support a wide variety of scenarios. For example, data storage in the server is not specified - the server may use flat files, databases, or just be a gateway to some other server.  Access control is not standardized, though there has been work on it and there are commonly used models.  Users'' passwords may be stored in their entries or elsewhere.  The server may refuse to perform operations when it wishes, and impose various limits. Most parts of LDAP are extensible. Examples: One can define new operations.  \r\n  <em>\r\n    Controls\r\n  </em>\r\n  may modify requests and responses, e.g. to request sorted search results.  New search scopes and Bind methods can be defined.  Attributes can have \r\n  <em>\r\n    options\r\n  </em>\r\n  that may modify their semantics. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Other data models</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  As LDAP has gained momentum, vendors have provided it as an access protocol to other services.  The implementation then recasts the data to mimic the LDAP/X.500 model, but how closely this model is followed varies.  For example, there is software to access \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>\r\n  databases through LDAP, even though LDAP does not readily lend itself to this.  \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.500">X.500</a>\r\n  servers may support LDAP as well. Similarly, data which were previously held in other types of data stores are sometimes moved to LDAP directories.  For example, Unix user and group information can be stored in LDAP and accessed via \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable%20Authentication%20Modules">PAM</a>\r\n  and \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name%20Service%20Switch">NSS</a>\r\n  modules.  LDAP is often used by other services for authentication. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Usage</h2>\r\n<h3>Applications</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  One reason to choose LDAP for a service is that it is quite widely supported, and data presented in LDAP is thus immediately available to many clients and libraries.  Another is that LDAP is very general and includes basic security, and can support many types of applications. Thus, if one chooses a few general protocols like LDAP and \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext%20Transfer%20Protocol">HTTP</a>\r\n  for various services, one can focus on these few protocols instead of having to maintain and upgrade many specialized protocols. Two common applications of LDAP are for computer user/group data, and for address book information (persons, departments etc).  Many e-mail clients support LDAP lookups. Some tasks LDAP does not handle well are to model a relational database, and data whose ordering must be preserved.  (However, an extension does exist for the latter.) \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Naming structure</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  Since an LDAP server can return referrals to other servers for requests the server itself will not/can not serve, a naming structure for LDAP entries is needed so one can find a server holding a given DN.  Since such a structure already exists in the \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain%20name%20system">Domain name system</a>\r\n  (DNS), servers'' top level names often mimic DNS names. If an organization has domain name foo.example, its top level LDAP entry will therefore typically have the DN dc=foo,dc=example (where dc means domain component).  If the LDAP server is also named ldap.foo.example, the organization''s top level LDAP URL becomes ldap://ldap.foo.example/dc=foo,dc=example. Below the top level, the entry names will typically reflect the organization''s internal structure or needs rather than DNS names. This is also a descendent of the X.500 series. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Terminology</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  The LDAP terminology one can encounter is rather cumbersome.  Some of this is due to misunderstandings, other examples are due to its historical origins, others arise when used with non-X.500 services that use different terminology.  For example, "LDAP" is sometimes used to refer to the protocol, other times to the protocol and the data.  An "LDAP directory" may be the data or also the access point. An "attribute" may be the attribute type, or the contents of an attribute in a directory, or an attribute description (an attribute type with \r\n  <em>\r\n    options\r\n  </em> ).  An "anonymous" and an "unauthenticated" Bind are different Bind methods that both produce anonymous authentication state, so both terms are being used for both variants.  The "uid" attribute should hold user names rather than numeric user IDs.\r\n</p>', '', 1, 2, 0, 0, '', '2008-06-22 23:41:56', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource, available from a different server. The proxy server provides the resource by connecting to the specified server and requesting the service on behalf of the client. A proxy server may optionally alter the client''s request or the server''s response, and sometimes it may serve the request without contacting the specified server. In this case, it would ''cache'' the first request to the remote server, so it could save the information for later, and make everything as fast as possible. A proxy server that passes all requests and replies unmodified is usually called a \r\n<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gateway%20%28computer%20networking%29">gateway</a>\r\nor sometimes \r\n<em>\r\n  tunneling proxy\r\n</em>. A proxy server can be placed in the user''s local computer or at specific key points between the user and the destination servers or the Internet. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Types and functions</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  Proxy servers implement one or more of the following functions:  \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Caching proxy server </h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  A proxy server can service requests without contacting the specified server, by retrieving content saved from a previous request, made by the same client or even other clients. This is called \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caching">caching</a>. Caching proxies keep local copies of frequently requested resources, allowing large organizations to significantly reduce their upstream bandwidth usage and cost, while significantly increasing performance. There are well-defined rules for caching. Some poorly-implemented caching proxies have had downsides (e.g., an inability to use user authentication). Some problems are described in RFC 3143 (Known HTTP Proxy/Caching Problems). \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Web proxy </h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  A proxy that focuses on WWW traffic is called a "web proxy". The most common use of a web proxy is to serve as a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/web%20cache">web cache</a>.  Most proxy programs (e.g. \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid%20%28software%29">Squid</a>, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetCache">NetCache</a>\r\n  ) provide a means to deny access to certain URLs in a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blacklist%20%28computing%29">blacklist</a>, thus providing content filtering.  This is usually used in a corporate environment, though with the increasing use of Linux in small businesses and homes, this function is no longer confined to large corporations. Some web proxies reformat web pages for a specific purpose or audience (e.g., cell phones and PDAs). \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Content Filtering Web Proxy </h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  {{see|Content-control software}} A \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/content%20filtering">content filtering</a>\r\n  web proxy server provides administrative control over the content that may be relayed through the proxy. It is commonly used in commercial and non-commercial organizations (especially schools) to ensure that Internet usage conforms to \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acceptable%20use%20policy">acceptable use policy</a>.  Common methods used for content filtering include: \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklist#Computing">URL</a>\r\n  or \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL">DNS blacklists</a>, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">URL</a>\r\n  regex filtering, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME">MIME</a>\r\n  filtering, or content keyword filtering.  Some products have been known to employ content analysis techniques to look for traits commonly used by certain types of content providers. A content filtering proxy will often support \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication#Computer%20security">user authentication</a>, to control web access. It also usually produces \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server%20log">logs</a>, either to give detailed information about the URLs accessed by specific users, or to monitor \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth%20%28computers%29">bandwidth</a>\r\n  usage statistics. It may also communicate to \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon%20%28computer%20software%29">daemon</a>\r\n  based and/or \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20Content%20Adaptation%20Protocol">ICAP</a>\r\n  based \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antivirus%20software">antivirus software</a>\r\n  to provide security against virus and other \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malware">malware</a>\r\n  by scanning incoming content in real time before it enters the network. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Anonymizing proxy server</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  An anonymous proxy server (sometimes called a web proxy) generally attempts to anonymize web surfing. These can easily be overridden by site administrators, and thus rendered useless in some cases. There are different varieties of \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anonymizer">anonymizers</a>. Access control:  Some proxy servers implement a logon requirement. In large organizations, authorized users must log on to gain access to the \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%20Wide%20Web">web</a>. The organization can thereby track usage to individuals. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Hostile proxy</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  Proxies can also be installed by online criminals, in order to \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eavesdrop">eavesdrop</a>\r\n  upon the dataflow between the client machine and the web.  All accessed pages, as well as all forms submitted, can be captured and analyzed by the proxy operator.  For this reason, passwords to online services (such as webmail and banking) should be changed if an unauthorized proxy is detected. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Intercepting proxy server</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  An \r\n  <strong>intercepting proxy</strong>\r\n  (also known as a "transparent proxy") combines a proxy server with a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway%20%28computer%20networking%29">gateway</a>. Connections made by client browsers through the gateway are redirected through the proxy without client-side configuration (or often knowledge). Intercepting proxies are commonly used in businesses to prevent avoidance of acceptable use policy, and to ease administrative burden, since no client browser configuration is required. It is often possible to detect the use of an intercepting proxy server by comparing the external IP address to the address seen by an external web server, or by examining the HTTP headers on the server side. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Transparent and non-transparent proxy server</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  The term "transparent proxy" is most often used incorrectly to mean "intercepting proxy" (because the client does not need to configure a proxy and cannot directly detect that its requests are being proxied). However, RFC 2616 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1) offers different definitions: \r\n</p>\r\n<dl>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    "A ''transparent proxy'' is a proxy that does not modify the request or response beyond what is required for proxy authentication and identification". "A ''non-transparent proxy'' is a proxy that modifies the request or response in order to provide some added service to the user agent, such as group annotation services, media type transformation, protocol reduction, or anonymity filtering".\r\n  </dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n<h3>Forced proxy</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  The term "forced proxy" is ambiguous. It means both "intercepting proxy" (because it filters all traffic on the only available gateway to the Internet) and its exact opposite, "non-intercepting proxy" (because the user is forced to configure a proxy in order to access the Internet). Forced proxy operation is sometimes necessary due to issues with the interception of TCP connections and HTTP.  For instance interception of HTTP requests can affect the usability of a proxy cache, and can greatly affect certain authentication mechanisms.  This is primarily because the client thinks it is talking to a server, and so request headers required by a proxy are unable to be distinguished from headers that may be required by an upstream server (esp authorization headers).  Also the HTTP specification prohibits caching of responses where the request contained an authorization header. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Open proxy server</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  {{main|open proxy}} Because proxies might be used for abuse, system administrators have developed a number of ways to refuse service to open proxies. many \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC">IRC</a>\r\n  networks automatically test client systems for known types of open proxy. Likewise, an \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mail%20transport%20agent">email server</a>\r\n  may be configured to automatically test \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electronic%20mail">e-mail</a>\r\n  senders for open proxies. Groups of IRC and electronic mail operators run \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSBL">DNSBLs</a>\r\n  publishing lists of the \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP%20address">IP addresses</a>\r\n  of known open proxies, such as \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHBL">AHBL</a>, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite%20Blocking%20List">CBL</a>, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NJABL">NJABL</a>, and \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SORBS">SORBS</a>. The ethics of automatically testing clients for open proxies are controversial. Some experts, such as \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon%20Schryver">Vernon Schryver</a>, consider such testing to be equivalent to an attacker \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portscanning">portscanning</a>\r\n  the client host. \r\n  <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=brd5b4%242kv3%241%40calcite.rhyolite.com&amp;output=gplain">[#]</a>\r\n  Others consider the client to have solicited the scan by connecting to a server whose terms of service include testing. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Reverse proxy server</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  {{main|reverse proxy}} A \r\n  <strong>reverse proxy</strong>\r\n  is a proxy server that is installed in the neighborhood of one or more web servers. All traffic coming from the Internet and with a destination of one of the web servers goes through the proxy server. There are several reasons for installing reverse proxy servers: \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Encryption / SSL acceleration: when secure web sites are created, the SSL encryption is often not done by the web server itself, but by a reverse proxy that is equipped with SSL acceleration hardware. See \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure%20Sockets%20Layer">Secure Sockets Layer</a>.</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load%20balancing%20%28computing%29">Load balancing</a>\r\n  : the reverse proxy can distribute the load to several web servers, each web server serving its own application area. In such a case, the reverse proxy may need to rewrite the URLs in each web page (translation from externally known URLs to the internal locations).</li>\r\n  <li>Serve/cache static content: A reverse proxy can offload the web servers by caching static content like pictures and other static graphical content.</li>\r\n  <li>Compression: the proxy server can optimize and compress the content to speed up the load time.</li>\r\n  <li>Spoon feeding: reduces resource usage caused by slow clients on the web servers by caching the content the web server sent and slowly "spoon feeds" it to the client. This especially benefits dynamically generated pages.</li>\r\n  <li>Security: the proxy server is an additional layer of defense and can protect against some OS and WebServer specific attacks.  However, it does not provide any protection to attacks against the web application or service itself, which is generally considered the larger threat.</li>\r\n  <li>Extranet Publishing: a reverse proxy server facing the Internet can be used to communicate to a firewalled server internal to an organization, providing extranet access to some functions while keeping the servers behind the firewalls.  If used in this way, security measures should be considered to protect the rest of your infrastructure in case this server is compromised, as it''s web application is exposed to attack from the Internet.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Circumventor</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  A \r\n  <strong>circumventor</strong>\r\n  is a method of defeating blocking policies implemented using proxy servers. Ironically, most circumventors are also proxy servers, of varying degrees of sophistication, which effectively implement "bypass policies". A circumventor is a web-based page that takes a site that is blocked and "circumvents" it through to an unblocked web site, allowing the user to view blocked pages. A famous example is \r\n  <strong>\r\n    <em>\r\n      ''elgooG\r\n    </em></strong>\r\n  '', which allowed users in \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</a>\r\n  to use \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a>\r\n  after it had been blocked there. \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elgooG">elgooG</a>\r\n  differs from most circumventors in that it circumvents only one block.  Students are able to access blocked sites (games, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chatroom">chatrooms</a>, messenger, offensive material, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet%20pornography">internet pornography</a>,  social networking, etc.) through a circumventor. As fast as the filtering software blocks circumventors, others spring up.  However, in some cases the filter may still intercept traffic to the circumventor, thus the person who manages the filter can still see the sites that are being visited. Circumventors are also used by people who have been blocked from a web site. Another use of a circumventor is to allow access to country-specific services, so that Internet users from other countries may also make use of them. An example is country-restricted reproduction of media and webcasting. The use of circumventors is usually safe with the exception that circumventor sites run by an untrusted third party can be run with hidden intentions, such as collecting personal information, and as a result users are typically advised against running personal data such as credit card numbers or passwords through a circumventor. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>At schools and offices</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  Many work places and schools restrict the web sites and online services that are made available in their buildings. Since circumventors are used to bypass censors in computers, social networking and other sites deemed a waste of time or resources have become targets of mass banning. Proxy Web server creators have become more sophisticated, allowing users to encrypt links and any data going to and from other web servers. This allows users to access websites that would otherwise have been blocked. A special case of web proxies are "CGI proxies". These are web sites that allow a user to access a site through them. They generally use \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a>\r\n  or \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common%20Gateway%20Interface">CGI</a>\r\n  to implement the proxy functionality. These types of proxies are frequently used to gain access to web sites blocked by corporate or school proxies. Since they also hide the user''s own \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP%20address">IP address</a>\r\n  from the web sites they access through the proxy, they are sometimes also used to gain a degree of \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anonymity">anonymity</a>, called "Proxy Avoidance". \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Risks of using anonymous proxy servers</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  In using a proxy server (for example, anonymizing \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a>\r\n  proxy), all data sent to the service being used (for example, HTTP server in a website) must pass through the proxy server before being sent to the service, mostly in unencrypted form. It is therefore possible, as has been demonstrated, for a malicious proxy server to record everything sent to the proxy: including unencrypted logins and passwords. By chaining proxies which do not reveal data about the original requester, it is possible to obfuscate activities from the eyes of the user''s destination. However, more traces will be left on the intermediate hops, which could be used or offered up to trace the user''s activities. If the policies and administrators of these other proxies are unknown, the user may fall victim to a false sense of security just because those details are out of sight and mind. The bottom line of this is to be wary when using proxy servers, and only use proxy servers of known integrity (e.g., the owner is known and trusted, has a clear privacy policy, etc.), and never use proxy servers of unknown integrity. If there is no choice but to use unknown proxy servers, do not pass any private information (unless it is properly encrypted) through the proxy. In what is more of an inconvenience than a risk, proxy users may find themselves being blocked from certain Web sites, as numerous forums and Web sites block IP addresses from proxies known to have \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam%20%28electronic%29">spammed</a>\r\n  or \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll%20%28Internet%29">trolled</a> the site.\r\n</p>', '', 1, 2, 0, 0, '', '2008-06-22 23:54:50', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

For \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/network%20monitoring">network monitoring</a>\r\n  purposes it may also be desirable to monitor all data packets in a LAN by using a network switch with a so-called \r\n  <em>\r\n    monitoring port\r\n  </em>, whose purpose is to mirror all packets passing through all ports of the switch. When systems (computers) are connected to a switch port rather than a hub the analyzer will be unable to read the data due to the intrinsic nature of switched networks. In this case a shadow port must be created in order for the sniffer to capture the data. On \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wireless%20LAN">wireless LANs</a>, one can capture traffic on a particular channel.

Typically, only the server is authenticated (\r\n  <em> i.e.\r\n  </em>, its identity is ensured) while the client remains unauthenticated; this means that the end user (whether an individual or an application, such as a Web browser) can be sure with whom it is communicating. The next level of security Ã¢â¬â in which both ends of the "conversation" are sure with whom they are communicating Ã¢â¬â is known as\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mutual%20authentication">mutual authentication</a>. Mutual authentication requires\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public%20key%20infrastructure">public key infrastructure</a> (PKI) deployment to clients unless\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS-PSK">TLS-PSK</a> or the\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure%20remote%20password%20protocol">Secure Remote Password</a> (SRP) protocol are used, which provide strong mutual authentication without needing to deploy a PKI.

The key exchange and authentication algorithms are typically public key algorithms, or as in\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS-PSK">TLS-PSK</a> preshared keys could be used.

During this handshake, the client and server agree on various parameters used to establish the connection''s security.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> The handshake begins when a client connects to a TLS-enabled server requesting a secure connection, and presents a list of supported\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/encryption">ciphers</a> and\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cryptographic%20hash%20function">hash functions</a>.</li>\r\n  <li>From this list, the server picks the strongest cipher and hash function that it also supports and notifies the client of the decision.</li>\r\n  <li> The server sends back its identification in the form of a\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digital%20certificate">digital certificate</a>. The certificate usually contains the server name, the trusted\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/certificate%20authority">certificate authority</a>\r\n  (CA), and the server''s public encryption key.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> The client may contact the server that issued the certificate (the trusted CA as above) and confirm that the certificate is authentic before proceeding.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>In order to generate the session keys used for the secure connection, the client encrypts a random number with the server''s public key, and sends the result to the server. Only the server can decrypt it (with its private key): this is the one fact that makes the keys hidden from third parties, since only the server and the client have access to this data.</li>\r\n  <li>From the random number, both parties generate key material for encryption and decryption.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> This concludes the handshake and begins the secured connection, which is encrypted and decrypted with the key material until the connection closes.\r\n  <em> If any one of the above steps fails, the TLS handshake fails, and the connection is not created.\r\n  </em>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>TLS handshake in detail </h3>\r\n<p> The TLS protocol exchanges\r\n  <em> records\r\n  </em>, which encapsulate the data to be exchanged. Each record can be compressed, padded, appended with a\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/message%20authentication%20code">message authentication code</a> (MAC), or encrypted, all depending on the state of the connection. Each record has a\r\n  <em> content type\r\n  </em> field that specifies the record, a length field, and a TLS version field. When the connection starts, the record encapsulates another protocol, the handshake messaging protocol, which has\r\n  <em> content type\r\n  </em> 22.\r\n</p>\r\n<h4>Simple TLS handshake </h4>\r\n<p> A simple connection example follows:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> A Client sends a\r\n  <strong>ClientHello</strong>\r\n  message specifying the highest TLS protocol version it supports, a random number, a list of suggested cipher suites and compression methods.</li>\r\n  <li> The Server responds with a\r\n  <strong>ServerHello</strong> message, containing the chosen protocol version, a random number, cipher suite, and compression method from the choices offered by the client. The server may also send a\r\n  <em> session id\r\n  </em>\r\n  as part of the message to perform a resumed handshake.</li>\r\n  <li> The Server sends its\r\n  <strong>Certificate</strong>\r\n  message (depending on the selected cipher suite, this may be omitted by the Server).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<dl>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <dl>\r\n      <dd>\r\n        <em> These certificates are currently\r\n          <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a>, but there is also a draft specifying the use of\r\n          <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenPGP">OpenPGP</a> based certificates.\r\n        </em>\r\n      </dd>\r\n    </dl>\r\n  </dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> The Server sends a\r\n  <strong>ServerHelloDone</strong>\r\n  message, indicating it is done with handshake negotiation.</li>\r\n  <li> The Client responds with a\r\n  <strong>ClientKeyExchange</strong> message, which may contain a\r\n  <em> PreMasterSecret\r\n  </em>, public key, or nothing. (Again, this depends on the selected cipher.)</li>\r\n  <li> The Client and Server then use the random numbers and PreMasterSecret to compute a common secret, called the "master secret".

Note that the ChangeCipherSpec is itself a record-level protocol, and has type 20, and not 22.</li>\r\n  <li> Finally, the Client sends an encrypted\r\n  <strong>Finished</strong>\r\n  message, containing a hash and MAC over the previous handshake messages.</li>\r\n  <li> The Server will attempt to decrypt the Client''s\r\n  <em> Finished\r\n  </em>\r\n  message, and verify the hash and MAC.

(Again, this depends on the selected cipher.) This\r\n  <em> PreMasterSecret\r\n  </em>\r\n  is encrypted using the public key of the server certificate.</li>\r\n  <li> The Client sends a\r\n  <strong>CertificateVerify</strong>\r\n  message, which is a signature over the previous handshake messages using the client''s certificate''s private key. This signature can be verified by using the client''s certificate''s public key. This lets the Server know that the Client has access to the private key of the certificate and thus owns the certificate.</li>\r\n  <li> The Client and Server then use the random numbers and\r\n  <em> PreMasterSecret\r\n  </em> to compute a common secret, called the "master secret". All other key data is derived from this master secret (and the client- and server-generated random values), which is passed through a carefully designed "\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pseudorandomness">pseudorandom</a>\r\n  function".</li>\r\n  <li> The Client now sends a\r\n  <strong>ChangeCipherSpec</strong> record, essentially telling the Server, "Everything I tell you from now on will be encrypted."

Application messages exchanged between Client and Server will be encrypted.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Resumed TLS Handshake</h4>\r\n<p> Public key operations (e.g. RSA) are considered expensive in terms of computational power. TLS provides a secure shortcut in the handshake mechanism to avoid these operations. The Server sends a\r\n  <em> session id\r\n  </em> as part of the\r\n  <strong>ServerHello</strong> message. The Client maps this\r\n  <em> session id\r\n  </em> to the Server''s IP address and TCP port, so that when the Client connects again to that Server, it can use the\r\n  <em> session id\r\n  </em> to shortcut the handshake. The\r\n  <em> session id\r\n  </em> maps to the cryptographic parameters previously negotiated, specifically the "master secret". Both sides must have the same "master secret" or the resumed handshake will fail (this prevents an eavesdropper from using a\r\n  <em> session id\r\n  </em> ). The random data in the\r\n  <strong>ClientHello</strong> and\r\n  <strong>ServerHello</strong> messages virtually guarantee that the generated session keys will be different than in the previous connection.\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> A Client sends a\r\n  <strong>ClientHello</strong> message specifying the highest TLS protocol version it supports, a random number, a list of suggested cipher suites and compression methods. Included in the message is the\r\n  <em> session id\r\n  </em>\r\n  from the previous TLS connection.</li>\r\n  <li> The Server responds with a\r\n  <strong>ServerHello</strong> message, containing the chosen protocol version, a random number, cipher suite, and compression method from the choices offered by the client. If the Server recognizes the\r\n  <em> session id\r\n  </em> sent by the client, it responds with the same\r\n  <em> session id\r\n  </em>. The Client uses this to recognize that a resumed handshake is being performed. If the server does not recognize the\r\n  <em> session id\r\n  </em> sent by the Client, it sends a different value for its\r\n  <em> session id\r\n  </em>. This tells the Client that a resumed handshake will not be performed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<dl>\r\n  <dd>\r\n    <dl>\r\n      <dd> At this point, both the Client and Server have the "master secret" and random data to generate the key data.\r\n      </dd>\r\n    </dl>\r\n  </dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> The Server now sends a\r\n  <strong>ChangeCipherSpec</strong> record, essentially telling the Client, "Everything I tell you from now on will be encrypted."

By forging the header so it contains a different address, an attacker can make it appear that the packet was sent by a different machine. The machine that receives spoofed packets will send response back to the forged source address, which means that this technique is mainly used when the attacker does not care about response or the attacker has some way of guessing the response. In certain cases, it might be possible for the attacker to see or redirect the response to his own machine. The most usual case is when the attacker is spoofing an address on the same \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local%20area%20network">LAN</a>\r\n  or WAN. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Uses of spoofing</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  IP spoofing is most frequently used in  \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denial-of-service%20attack">denial-of-service attacks</a>.  In such attacks, the goal is to flood the victim with overwhelming amounts of traffic, and the attacker does not care about receiving responses to his attack packets.  Packets with spoofed addresses are thus suitable for such attacks.  They have additional advantages for this purpose - they are more difficult to filter since each spoofed packet appears to come from a different address, and they hide the true source of the attack.  Denial of service attacks that use spoofing typically randomly choose addresses from the entire IP address space, though more sophisticated spoofing mechanisms might avoid unroutable addresses or unused portions of the IP address space.  The proliferation of large \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/botnet">botnets</a>\r\n  makes spoofing less important in denial of service attacks, but attackers typically have spoofing available as a tool, if they want to use it, so defenses against denial-of-service attacks that rely on the validity of the source IP address in attack packets might have trouble with spoofed packets.  \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter%20%28DDOS%29">Backscatter</a>, a technique used to observe denial-of-service attack activity in the Internet, relies on attackers'' use of IP spoofing for its effectiveness. IP spoofing can also be a method of attack used by network intruders to defeat network security measures, such as \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/authentication">authentication</a>\r\n  based on IP addresses. This method of attack on a remote system can be extremely difficult, as it involves modifying thousands of packets at a time. This type of attack is most effective where trust relationships exist between machines. For example, it is common on some corporate networks to have internal systems trust each other, so that a user can log in without a username or password provided they are connecting from another machine on the internal network (and so must already be logged in). By spoofing a connection from a trusted machine, an attacker may be able to access the target machine without authenticating. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Defense against spoofing</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network%20layer%20firewall">Packet filtering</a>\r\n  is one defense against IP spoofing attacks. The gateway to a network usually performs \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ingress%20filtering">ingress filtering</a>, which is blocking of packets from outside the network with a source address inside the network. This prevents an outside attacker spoofing the address of an internal machine. Ideally the gateway would also perform \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egress%20filtering">egress filtering</a>\r\n  on outgoing packets, which is blocking of packets from inside the network with a source address that is not inside. This prevents an attacker within the network performing filtering from launching IP spoofing attacks against external machines. It is also recommended to design network protocols and services so that they do not rely on the IP source address for authentication. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Upper layers</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  Some \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upper%20layer%20protocol">upper layer protocols</a>\r\n  provide their own defense against IP spoofing. For example, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission%20Control%20Protocol">Transmission Control Protocol</a>\r\n  (TCP) uses sequence numbers negotiated with the remote machine to ensure that arriving packets are part of an established connection. Since the attacker normally can''t see any reply packets, he has to guess the sequence number in order to hijack the connection. The poor implementation in many older operating systems and network devices, however, means that TCP sequence numbers can be predicted. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Other definitions</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  The term \r\n  <strong>\r\n    <em>\r\n      spoofing\r\n    </em></strong>\r\n  is also sometimes used to refer to \r\n  <em>\r\n    header forgery\r\n  </em>, the insertion of false or misleading information in \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/e-mail%20spoofing">e-mail</a>\r\n  or \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netnews">netnews</a>\r\n  headers.

ARP is not an IP-only or \r\n<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a>\r\n-only protocol; it can be used to resolve many different network-layer protocol addresses to hardware addresses, although, due to the overwhelming prevalence of \r\n<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">IPv4</a>\r\nand Ethernet, ARP is primarily used to translate \r\n<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP%20address">IP addresses</a>\r\nto Ethernet \r\n<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC%20address">MAC addresses</a>.

The last three cases are the most used over the \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>\r\n  as two computers on the Internet are typically separated by more than 3 \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hop%20%28telecommunications%29">hops</a>. In the first case, you would have two hosts, A and B, on the same \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN%20segment">LAN segment</a>.  If, for example, Host A wants to send an IPv4 packet to Host B, Host A must already have an IPv4 (\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/network%20layer">network layer</a>\r\n  ) address for Host B.  However, in order to be able to send the packet on the LAN to Host B, Host A must also have a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/data%20link%20layer">data link layer</a>\r\n  address, i.e. a MAC address, for Host B.  If it doesn''t already know that MAC address, it would send an ARP request to ask for that MAC address, in hope of getting a reply from Host B, or another host on the network, returning the required MAC address. In the second case, for the same example, hosts A and B would be on different network segments, but there would be a router on the same LAN segment as Host A, which is either on the same network segment as Host B, or on the same network segment as \r\n  <em>\r\n    another\r\n  </em>\r\n  router that is on the same network segment as Host B, or on the same network segment as another router that is on the same network segment as yet \r\n  <em>\r\n    another\r\n  </em>\r\n  router that is on the same segment as Host B, and so on.  Host A would send the IPv4 packet not to Host B, but to the first of those routers; it would look up Host B in its \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/routing%20table">routing table</a>\r\n  to determine the IPv4 address of the appropriate router.  It would then, if it doesn''t already know the MAC address of that router, use ARP to determine that MAC address. The third case is similar to the second case; the router would look up Host B in its routing table to determine the IPv4 address of the next router to which it should send the packet and, if it doesn''t already know the MAC address for the router, use ARP to determine that MAC address.  The fourth case is similar to the first case; the router has determined that Host B is on the same LAN segment, and, if it doesn''t already know Host B''s MAC address, will use ARP to determine that MAC address.

The term\r\n<em> telnet\r\n</em> also refers to software which implements the client part of the protocol. TELNET clients have been available on most\r\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</a> systems for many years and are available for virtually all\r\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform%20%28computing%29">platforms</a>. Most network equipment and\r\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating%20System">OSs</a> with a\r\n<a href="javascript:article(101);">TCP/IP Stack</a> support some kind of TELNET service server for their remote configuration (including ones based on\r\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows%20NT">Windows NT</a> ). Because of security issues with TELNET, its use has waned as it is replaced by the use of\r\n<a href="javascript:article(104);">SSH</a> for remote access. "To telnet" is also used as a\r\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verb">verb</a> meaning to establish or use a TELNET or other interactive TCP connection, as in, "To change your password, telnet to the server and run the\r\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/passwd">passwd</a> command". Most often, a user will be\r\n<em> telnetting\r\n</em> to a Unix-like server system or a simple network device such as a router. For example, a user might "telnet in from home to check his mail at school". In doing so, he would be using a telnet client to connect from his computer to one of his servers. Once the connection is established, he would then log in with his account information and execute operating system commands remotely on that computer, such as\r\n<tt> ls\r\n</tt> or\r\n<tt> cd\r\n</tt>. On many systems, the client may also be used to make interactive raw-\r\n<a href="javascript:article(101);">TCP</a> sessions.  It is commonly believed that a telnet session which does not include an IAC (character 255) is functionally identical.  This is not the case however due to special NVT (\r\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network%20Virtual%20Terminal">Network Virtual Terminal</a> ) rules such as the requirement for a bare CR (ASCII 13) to be followed by a NULL (ASCII 0).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h2>Protocol details</h2>\r\nTELNET is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/client-server%20protocol">client-server protocol</a>, based on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability%20%28computer%20networking%29">reliable</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/connection-oriented">connection-oriented</a> transport.  Typically this protocol used to establish a connection to  <a href="javascript:article(101);">TCP</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP%20and%20UDP%20port">port</a> 23, where a\r\n  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/getty%20%28Unix%29">getty</a> -equivalent program (telnetd) is listening, although TELNET predates TCP/IP and was originally run on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network%20Control%20Program">NCP</a>. Initially, TELNET was an ad-hoc protocol with no official definition.  Essentially, it used an 8-bit channel to exchange 7-bit ASCII data.  Any byte with the high bit set was a special TELNET character. On March 5th, 1973, a meeting was held at UCLA  where "New TELNET" was defined in two NIC documents: TELNET Protocol Specification, NIC #15372, and TELNET Option Specifications, NIC #15373. The protocol has many extensions, some of which have been adopted as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20standard">Internet standards</a>. IETF standards STD 27 through STD 32 define various extensions, most of which are extremely common. Other extensions are on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF%20standards%20track">IETF standards track</a> as proposed standards.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h2>Security</h2>\r\nWhen TELNET was initially developed in 1969, most users of networked computers were in the computer departments of academic institutions, or at large private and government research facilities. In this environment, security was not nearly as much of a concern as it became after the bandwidth explosion of the 1990s. The rise in the number of people with access to the Internet, and by extension, the number of people attempting to  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black%20hat">crack</a> other people''s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server%20%28computing%29">servers</a> made encrypted alternatives much more of a necessity. Experts in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computer%20security">computer security</a>, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SANS%20Institute">SANS Institute</a>, and the members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comp.os.linux.security">comp.os.linux.security</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newsgroup">newsgroup</a> recommend that the use of TELNET for remote logins should be discontinued under all normal circumstances, for the following reasons:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>TELNET, by default, does not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/encryption">encrypt</a> any data sent over the connection (including passwords), and so it is often practical to eavesdrop on the communications and use the password later for malicious purposes; anybody who has access to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/router">router</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/network%20switch">switch</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/network%20hub">hub</a> or\r\n  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway%20%28computer%20networking%29">gateway</a> located on the network between the two hosts where TELNET is being used can intercept the packets passing by and obtain login and password information (and whatever else is typed) with any of several common utilities like\r\n  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tcpdump">tcpdump</a> and\r\n  <a href="javascript:article(19);">Wireshark</a>.</li>\r\n  <li> Most implementations of TELNET have no authentication to ensure that communication is carried out between the two desired\r\n  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/server%20%28computing%29">hosts</a> and not <a href="javascript:article(141);">intercepted in the middle</a>.</li>\r\n  <li> Commonly used TELNET\r\n  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daemon%20%28computer%20software%29">daemons</a> have several\r\n  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vulnerability%20%28computer%20science%29">vulnerabilities</a>\r\n  discovered over the years.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</P>\r\n<p> These security-related shortcomings have seen the usage of the TELNET protocol drop rapidly, especially on the public Internet, in favor of the  <a href="javascript:article(104);">SSH</a> protocol, first released in 1995. SSH provides much of the functionality of telnet, with the addition of strong encryption to prevent sensitive data such as passwords from being intercepted, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public%20key">public key</a> authentication, to ensure that the remote computer is actually who it claims to be. As has happened with other early Internet protocols, extensions to the TELNET protocol provide <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport%20Layer%20Security">TLS</a> security and  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple%20Authentication%20and%20Security%20Layer">SASL</a> authentication that address the above issues.  However, most TELNET implementations do not support these extensions; and there has been relatively little interest in implementing these as SSH is adequate for most purposes.  The main advantage of TLS-TELNET would be the ability to use certificate-authority signed server certificates to authenticate a server host to a client that does not yet have the server key stored.  In SSH, there is a weakness in that the user must trust the first session to a host when it has not yet acquired the server key.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h2>Current status</h2>\r\nAs of the mid-2000s, while the TELNET protocol itself has been mostly superseded for remote login, TELNET clients are still used, often when diagnosing problems, to manually "talk" to other services without specialized client software. For example, it is sometimes used in\r\n  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/debug">debugging</a> network services such as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP">SMTP</a>,\r\n  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20Relay%20Chat">IRC</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a>,\r\n  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTP">FTP</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POP3">POP3</a> server, by serving as a simple way to send commands to the server and examine the responses. This approach has limitations as TELNET clients speak is close to, but not equivalent to, raw mode (due to terminal control handshaking and the special rules regarding \\377 and \\15). Thus, other software such as\r\n  <em> nc\r\n  </em> (\r\n  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netcat">netcat</a> ) or\r\n  <em> socat\r\n  </em> on Unix (or\r\n  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PuTTY">PuTTY</a> on Windows) are finding greater favor with some system administrators for testing purposes, as they can be called with arguments not to send any terminal control\r\n  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/handshaking">handshaking</a> data. Also netcat does not distort the \\377 octet, which allows raw access to TCP socket, unlike any standard-compliant TELNET software.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<h2>TELNET is popular with</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li> enterprise networks to access host applications, e.g. on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM">IBM</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe%20computer">Mainframes</a>.</li>\r\n  <li> administration of network elements, e.g., in commissioning, integration and maintenance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/core%20network">core network</a> elements in  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mobile%20communication">mobile communication</a> networks.</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a> games played over the Internet, as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talker">talkers</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSH">MUSHes</a>,\r\n  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUCK">MUCKs</a>,  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO">MOOes</a>, and the resurgent\r\n  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBS</a>  community.</li>\r\n  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/embedded%20system">embedded systems</a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</P>\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<h2>External links</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PuTTY">PuTTY</a> is a free, open source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH">SSH</a>, TELNET, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rlogin">rlogin</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission%20Control%20Protocol">raw TCP</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%20%28computing%29">client</a> for Windows, Linux, and Unix.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</P>', '', 1, 2, 0, 0, '', '2008-06-23 00:36:20', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Typing ''i'' while in normal mode switches the editor to insert mode.  Typing ''i'' again at this point places an ''i'' character in the document.  How the ''i'' keystroke is processed depends on the editor mode.  (From insert mode, pressing the\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escape%20key">escape key</a> switches the editor back to normal mode.) vi can process compound commands that embed text for insertion in the document.  For example, the command:\r\n</p>\r\n<pre>20iHello world!\r\n</pre>\r\n<p> would insert 20 lines in the document with the text ''Hello world!''.  Rather than grapple with the notion of two mode switches while executing this command, some users view vi as a\r\n  <strong>stateful filter</strong>.  After processing the third character, vi changes state and begins processing input as text to be added to the file.  On processing the escape, vi returns to the state in which it is ready to receive a new command. Whether viewed as modal or stateful, vi''s processing of the same keystroke in different ways depending on the history of the edit session distinguishes it from editors which are generally considered non-modal. A perceived advantage of a modal editor is that the use of keyboard chords (multiple keys pressed simultaneously, typically a modifier plus a letter key) is reduced or eliminated.  Instead, in normal mode, single keystrokes serve as commands.  This results in the user''s hands not having to take up awkward positions, which some find results in faster work. {{Fact|date=January 2008}}\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Operation </h2>\r\n<p> Upon start-up, vi starts in normal mode (unless instructed otherwise). Typing the letter ''i'' (without quotes) enters\r\n  <strong>insert mode</strong>. Any text typed thence gets added to the document, until the escape key is pressed, at which point the\r\n  <strong>insert mode</strong> is exited and vi switches to\r\n  <strong>normal mode</strong>. (There are few more commands that switch the editor into insert mode, but they differ only in where the new text will go - before the cursor, after the cursor, above current line, below current line, etc.).\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Vi commands</h3>\r\n<p> There are two main classes of commands: cursor movements and text modification. Vi is the fullscreen counterpart to ex, and cursor movement is a key part of the design.\r\n</p>\r\n<dl>\r\n  <dt> Motions\r\n  </dt>\r\n</dl>\r\n<p> These commands move the cursor, either relative to its current position, or to an absolute position. Relative motions can be prefixed with a count, to tell vi to repeat the motion. These are relative motion commands:\r\n  <table>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n      <tr valign="top">\r\n        <td width="75">\r\n          <code> h\r\n          </code> &nbsp;\r\n          <code> j\r\n          </code> &nbsp;\r\n          <code> k\r\n          </code> &nbsp;\r\n          <code> l\r\n          </code></td>\r\n        <td> Move the cursor to the left, down, up, right, respectively.

They can be prefixed with a count (to repeat the operator), and are suffixed with a\r\n  <em> motion\r\n  </em> command.  The text between the current position and the final position (after the motion) is called a\r\n  <em> region\r\n  </em>. These are examples of operators:\r\n  <table>\r\n    <tbody>\r\n      <tr valign="top">\r\n        <td width="75">\r\n          <code> d\r\n          </code>\r\n          &nbsp;&nbsp;</td>\r\n        <td>\r\n          delete a region.

Thus "dd" deletes the current line, and "cc\r\n  <em> new\r\n  </em>\r\n  <esc> " replaces the entire current line with the text ''new''.  Prefixing it with a count repeats (or makes it apply to more than one), e.g., "10dd" deletes 10 lines.\r\n  </esc>\r\n</p>\r\n<dl>\r\n  <dt> Inline Commands\r\n  </dt>\r\n</dl>\r\n<p> A few commands move the cursor only within the current line.

The attacker must be able to intercept all messages going between the two victims and inject new ones, which is straightforward in many circumstances (for example, the owner of a public wireless access point can in principle conduct MITM attacks on the users). A man-in-the-middle attack can only be successful when the attacker can impersonate each endpoint to the satisfaction of the other. Most cryptographic protocols include some form of endpoint \r\n<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/authentication">authentication</a>\r\nspecifically to prevent MITM attacks. For example, \r\n<a href="javascript:article(134);">SSL</a>\r\nauthenticates the server using a mutually trusted \r\n<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/certification%20authority">certification authority</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>The need for an additional transfer over a secure channel </h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  With the exception of the \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlock%20Protocol">Interlock Protocol</a>, all cryptographic systems that are secure against \r\n  <strong>MITM</strong>\r\n  <strong>attacks</strong>\r\n  require an additional exchange or transmission of information over some kind of \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secure%20channel">secure channel</a>. Many \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/key%20agreement">key agreement</a>\r\n  methods with different security requirements for the secure channel have been developed. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Example of a successful MITM attack against public-key encryption</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  Suppose \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%20and%20Bob">Alice</a>\r\n  wishes to communicate with Bob. Meanwhile, Mallory wishes to eavesdrop on the conversation, or possibly deliver a false message to Bob. To get started, Alice must ask Bob for his \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public-key%20cryptography">public key</a>. If Bob sends his public key to Alice, but Mallory is able to intercept it, a man-in-the-middle attack can begin. Mallory sends a forged message to Alice that claims to be from Bob, but includes Mallory''s public key. Alice, believing this public key to be Bob''s, then encrypts her message with Mallory''s key and sends the enciphered message back to Bob. Mallory again intercepts, deciphers the message, keeps a copy, and reenciphers it (after alteration if desired) using the public key Bob originally sent to Alice. When Bob receives the newly enciphered message, he will believe it came from Alice. This example shows the need for Alice and Bob to have some way to ensure that they are truly using each other''s public keys, rather than the public key of an attacker. Otherwise, such attacks are generally possible, in principle, against any message sent using public-key technology. Fortunately, there are a variety of techniques that help defend against MITM attacks. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Defenses against the attack</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  Various defenses against MITM attacks use authentication techniques that are based on: \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public%20key%20infrastructure">Public key infrastructures</a></li>\r\n  <li>Stronger \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mutual%20authentication">mutual authentication</a></li>\r\n  <li>Secret keys (high \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/information%20entropy">information entropy</a>\r\n  secrets)</li>\r\n  <li>Passwords (low information entropy secrets)</li>\r\n  <li>Other criteria, such as voice recognition or other biometrics</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record%20Messaging">Off-the-Record Messaging</a>\r\n  for instant messenging</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n  The integrity of public keys must generally be assured in some manner, but need not be secret. Passwords and shared secret keys have the additional secrecy requirement. Public keys can be verified by a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate%20Authority">Certificate Authority</a>, whose public key is distributed through a secure channel (for example, with a web browser or OS installation).

(142, 4, NULL, 'DNS Spoofing', '', 'Learn more about DNS cache poisoning.', '<P>This article is a copy from:\r\n  <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_cache_poisoning" target="_blank">Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</A>\r\n</P>\r\n<P>\r\n<strong>DNS cache poisoning</strong>\r\nis a technique that tricks a Domain Name Server (<a href="javascript:article(143);">DNS Server</a>) into believing it has received authentic information when, in reality, it has not.  Once the DNS server has been poisoned, the information is generally <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cached">cached</a>\r\nfor a while, spreading the effect of the attack to the users of the server. Normally, an Internet-connected computer uses a DNS server provided by the computer owner''s \r\n<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20Service%20Provider">Internet Service Provider</a>, or ISP.  This DNS server generally serves the ISP''s own customers only and contains a small amount of DNS information cached by previous users of the server.  A poisoning attack on a single ISP DNS server can affect the users serviced directly by the compromised server or indirectly by its downstream server(s) if applicable. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h2>Details</h2>\r\n  To perform a cache poisoning attack, the attacker exploits a flaw in the DNS (Domain Name Server) software that can make it accept incorrect information.  If the server does not correctly validate DNS responses to ensure that they have come from an authoritative source, the server will end up caching the incorrect entries locally and serve them to users that make the same request. This technique can be used to replace arbitrary content for a set of victims with content of an attacker''s choosing.  For example, an attacker poisons the IP address DNS entries for a target website on a given DNS server, replacing them with the IP address of a server he controls. He then creates fake entries for files on the server they control with names matching those on the target server. These files could contain \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malicious">malicious</a>\r\n  content, such as a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computer%20worm">worm</a>\r\n  or a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computer%20virus">virus</a>.  A user whose computer has referenced the poisoned DNS server would be tricked into thinking that the content comes from the target server and unknowingly download malicious content. As part of the \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden%20Shield%20Project">Golden Shield Project</a>, \r\n  China regularly engages in DNS Poisoning for particular sites or networks which violate the policies that the project operates under.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h2>Variants</h2>\r\n  In the following variants, the entries for the server \r\n  <tt>\r\n    ns.wikipedia.org\r\n  </tt>\r\n  would be poisoned and redirected to the attacker''s nameserver at IP address \r\n  <tt>\r\n    w.x.y.z\r\n  </tt>.  These attacks assume that the nameserver for \r\n  <tt>\r\n    wikipedia.org\r\n  </tt>\r\n  is \r\n  <tt>\r\n    ns.wikipedia.org\r\n  </tt>.   To accomplish the attacks, the attacker must force the target DNS server to make a request for a domain controlled by one of the attacker''s nameservers.   \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Redirect the target domain''s nameserver</h3>\r\n  The first variant of DNS cache poisoning involves redirecting the nameserver of the attacker''s domain to the nameserver of the target domain, then assigning that nameserver an IP address specified by the attacker.   DNS server''s request: what are the address records for \r\n  <tt>\r\n    subdomain.example.com\r\n  </tt>\r\n  ? \r\n</p>\r\n<pre>subdomain.example.com. IN A\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>\r\n  Attacker''s response: \r\n</p>\r\n<pre>Answer:\r\n(no response)\r\nAuthority section:\r\nexample.com. 3600 IN NS ns.wikipedia.org.\r\nAdditional section:\r\nns.wikipedia.org. IN A w.x.y.z\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>\r\n  A vulnerable server would cache the additional A-record (IP address) for \r\n  <tt>\r\n    ns.wikipedia.org\r\n  </tt>, allowing the attacker to resolve queries to the entire \r\n  <tt>\r\n    wikipedia.org\r\n  </tt>\r\n  domain. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Redirect the NS record to another target domain</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  The second variant of DNS cache poisoning involves redirecting the nameserver of another domain unrelated to the original request to an IP address specified by the attacker.   DNS server''s request: what are the address records for \r\n  <tt>\r\n    subdomain.example.com\r\n  </tt>\r\n  ? \r\n</p>\r\n<pre>subdomain.example.com. IN A\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>\r\n  Attacker''s response: \r\n</p>\r\n<pre>Answer:\r\n(no response)\r\nAuthority section:\r\nwikipedia.org. 3600 IN NS ns.example.com.\r\nAdditional section:\r\nns.example.com. IN A w.x.y.z\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>\r\n  A vulnerable server would cache the unrelated authority information for \r\n  <tt>\r\n    wikipedia.org\r\n  </tt>\r\n  ''s NS-record (nameserver entry), allowing the attacker to resolve queries to the entire \r\n  <tt>\r\n    wikipedia.org\r\n  </tt>\r\n  domain. \r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Responding before the real nameserver</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  The third variant of DNS cache poisoning, which is called \r\n  <strong>DNS Forgery</strong>, involves beating the real answer to a recursive DNS query back to the DNS server.  DNS requests contain a 16-bit \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cryptographic%20nonce">nonce</a>, used to identify the response associated with a given request.  If the attacker can successfully predict the value of the nonce and return a reply first, the server will accept the attacker''s response as valid.    If the server randomizes the source port of the request, the attack may become more difficult, as the fake response must be sent to the same port that the request originated from.   By sending a number of simultaneous DNS requests to the server to force it to send more recursive requests, the probability of successfully predicting one of the request nonces increases.  This modification is a form of \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/birthday%20attack">birthday attack</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Prevention and mitigation</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  Many cache poisoning attacks can be simply prevented by DNS servers being less trusting of the information passed to them by other DNS servers, and ignoring any DNS records passed back which are not directly relevant to the query. For example, recent versions of \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND">BIND</a>\r\n  now contain code that performs these checks. As stated above, source port randomization for DNS requests, combined with the use of cryptographically-secure random numbers for selecting both the source port and the 16-bit \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cryptographic%20nonce">nonce</a>, can greatly reduce the probability of successful DNS race attacks. Unlike \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerDNS">PowerDNS</a>, and \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djbdns">Djbdns</a>, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND">BIND</a>\r\n  binds to a static udp listen port upon startup and thus is unable to randomize source port numbers. A secure version of DNS, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSSEC">DNSSEC</a>, uses cryptographic electronic signatures signed with a trusted \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public%20key%20certificate">digital certificate</a>\r\n  to determine the authenticity of data.  DNSSEC can counter cache poisoning attacks, but as of 2008 is not widely deployed. This kind of attack may also be mitigated at the \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transport%20layer">transport layer</a>\r\n  or \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/application%20layer">application layer</a>\r\n  to perform end-to-end validation once a connection is set up to an endpoint. A common example of this is the use of \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport%20Layer%20Security">Transport Layer Security</a>\r\n  and \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digital%20signature">digital signatures</a>.  For example, by using the secure version of \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a>, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>, users may check whether the server''s digital certificate is valid and belongs to a website''s expected owner. Similarly, the \r\n  <a href="javascript:article(104);">SSH</a> remote login program checks digital certificates at endpoints (if known) before proceeding with the session. For applications that download updates automatically, the application can embed a copy of the data''s signing certificate locally and validate the signature stored in the software update against the embedded certificate.\r\n</p>', '', 1, 2, 0, 0, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The vulnerability tests, available as subscriptions, are written in \r\n  <strong>NASL</strong>\r\n  (Nessus Attack Scripting Language), a scripting language optimized for custom network interaction.  \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenable%20Network%20Security">Tenable Network Security</a>\r\n  produces several dozen new vulnerability checks (called plugins) each week, usually on a daily basis. These checks are available for free to the general public seven days after they are initially published. Nessus users who require support and the latest vulnerability checks should contact Tenable Network Security for a Direct Feed subscription which is not free. Commercial customers are also allowed to access vulnerability checks without the seven-day delay. Optionally, the results of the scan can be reported in various formats, such as \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plain%20text">plain text</a>, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>, \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>\r\n  and \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>. The results can also be saved in a knowledge base for reference against future vulnerability scans. On UNIX, scanning can be automated through the use of a command-line client. There exist many different commercial, free and open source tools for both UNIX and Windows to manage individual or distributed Nessus scanners.  If the user chooses to do so (by disabling the option ''safe checks''), some of Nessus''s vulnerability tests may try to cause vulnerable services or operating systems to \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crash%20%28computing%29">crash</a>. This lets a user test the resistance of a device before putting it in production. Nessus provides additional functionality beyond testing for known network vulnerabilities. For instance, it can use \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a>\r\n  credentials to examine patch levels on computers running the Windows operating system, and can perform \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/password">password</a>\r\n  auditing using \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dictionary%20attack">dictionary</a>\r\n  and \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brute%20force">brute force</a>\r\n  methods. Nessus 3 can also audit systems to make sure they have been configured per a specific policy, such as the NSA''s guide for hardening Windows servers. \r\n</p>\r\n<P>\r\n<h2>External links </h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n  <a href="http://www.nessus.org/" target="_blank">Nessus homepage</a></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</P>', '', 1, 2, 0, 0, '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

MD5 is an 128-bit encryption. Compared to other cryptographic encrytions, MD5 is very fast to compute under a 32-bit computer&mdash;that''s why it is so widely used. You can read RFC 1321 (The MD5 Message-Digest Algirthm) for technical details.<br /><br /><strong> Where is MD5 used?</strong><br /> MD5 is used on virtually all forums and interactive online communities that involves authentication. If you ever used Invision Power Board, OpenBB, or vBulletin&mdash; their user passwords are all encrypted in MD5. MD5 is also used in verifying data integrity&mdash;meaning to make sure that data has not been changed. This procedure is called finding the MD5 checksum.<br /><br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Vulnerability</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  Because MD5 makes only one pass over the data, if two prefixes with the same hash can be constructed, a common suffix can be added to both to make the collision more reasonable. Because the current collision-finding techniques allow the preceding hash state to be specified arbitrarily, a collision can be found for any desired prefix; that is, for any given string of characters X, two colliding files can be determined which both begin with X. All that is required to generate two colliding files is a template file, with a 128-byte block of data aligned on a 64-byte boundary, that can be changed freely by the collision-finding algorithm. Recently, a number of projects have created MD5 "\r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainbow%20table">rainbow tables</a>\r\n  " which are easily accessible online, and can be used to reverse many MD5 hashes into strings that collide with the original input, usually for the purposes of \r\n  <a href="javascript:article(18);" title="Passwords">password</a>\r\n  cracking. However, if passwords are combined with a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salt%20%28cryptography%29">salt</a>\r\n  before the MD5 digest is generated, rainbow tables become much less useful. The use of MD5 in some websites'' \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator">URLs</a>\r\n  means that Google can also sometimes function as a limited tool for reverse lookup of MD5 hashes.  \r\n  This technique is rendered ineffective by the use of a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29">salt</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Applications</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  MD5 digests have been widely used in the software world to provide some assurance that a transferred file has arrived intact. For example, file servers often provide a pre-computed MD5 \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/checksum">checksum</a>\r\n  for the files, so that a user can compare the checksum of the downloaded file to it. \r\n  Unix-based operating systems include MD5 sum utilities in their distribution packages, whereas Windows users use third-party applications.  However, now that it is easy to generate MD5 collisions, it is possible for the person who created the file to create a second file with the same checksum, so this technique cannot protect against some forms of malicious tampering. Also, in some cases the checksum cannot be trusted (for example, if it was obtained over the same channel as the downloaded file), in which case MD5 can only provide error-checking functionality: it will recognize a corrupt or incomplete download, which becomes more likely when downloading larger files.  MD5 is widely used to store \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password#Form%20of%20stored%20passwords">passwords</a>.  To mitigate against the vulnerabilities mentioned above, one can add a \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt%20%28cryptography%29">salt</a>\r\n  to the passwords before hashing them. Some implementations may apply the hashing function more than once, see \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/key%20strengthening">key strengthening</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>MD5 hashes</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  The 128-bit (16-byte) MD5 hashes (also termed \r\n  <em>\r\n    message digests\r\n  </em>\r\n  ) are typically represented as a sequence of 32 \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a>\r\n  digits.  The following demonstrates a 43-byte \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a>\r\n  input and the corresponding MD5 hash: \r\n</p>\r\n<pre> MD5("<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20quick%20brown%20fox%20jumps%20over%20the%20lazy%20dog">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</a>")\r\n= 9e107d9d372bb6826bd81d3542a419d6\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>\r\n  Even a small change in the message will (with overwhelming probability) result in a completely different hash, due to the \r\n  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/avalanche%20effect">avalanche effect</a>.

Initially\r\ndeveloped for the UNIX operating system, it currently runs on fifteen\r\ndifferent platforms (11 architecture- specific avors of Unix, DOS,\r\nWin32, BeOS, and OpenVMS). It is one of the most popular password\r\ntesting/breaking programs as it combines a number of password crackers\r\ninto one package, autodetects password hash types, and includes a\r\ncustomizable cracker. It can be run against various encrypted password\r\nformats including several crypt password hash types most commonly found\r\non various Unix avors (based on DES, MD5, or Blowfish), Kerberos AFS,\r\nand Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 LM hash. Additional modules have extended\r\nits ability to include MD4-based password hashes and passwords stored\r\nin LDAP, MySQL and others.</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Sample output </strong></p>\r\n<pre>Here is a sample output in a Debian GNU/Linux environment.<br /><br />root@0[john-1.6.37]# cat pass.txt<br />user:AZl.zWwxIh15Q<br />root@0[john-1.6.37]# john -w:password.lst pass.txt<br />Loaded 1 password hash (Traditional DES [24/32 4K])<br />example (user)<br />guesses: 1 time: 0:00:00:00 100% c/s: 752 trying: 12345 - pookie<br /></pre>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span class="mw-headline">Attack types </span></h2>\r\n<p>One of the modes John can use is the dictionary attack. It takes\r\ntext string samples (usually from a file, called a wordlist, containing\r\nwords found in a dictionary), encrypting it in the same format as the\r\npassword being examined (including both the encryption algorithm and\r\nkey), and comparing the output to the encrypted string. It can also\r\nperform a variety of alterations to the dictionary words and try these.\r\nMany of these alterations are also used in John''s single attack mode,\r\nwhich modifies an associated plaintext (such as a username with an\r\nencrypted password) and checks the variations against the encrypted\r\nhashes.\r\nJohn also offers a brute force mode. In this type of attack, the\r\nprogram goes through all the possible plaintexts, hashing each one and\r\ncomparing it to the input hash. John uses character frequency tables to\r\ntry plaintexts containing more frequently-used characters first. This\r\nmethod is useful for cracking passwords which do not appear in\r\ndictionary wordlists, but it does take a long time (for all practical\r\npurposes, forever) to run.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span class="mw-headline">Usage of John </span></h2>\r\n<p>To use John, you just need to supply it a password file and the\r\ndesired options.</p>\r\n<p>First, you need to get a copy of your password file. If your system\r\nuses shadow passwords, you may use John''s "unshadow" utility to obtain\r\nthe traditional Unix password file, as root:</p>\r\n<pre>  umask 077<br /><br />  unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow &gt; mypasswd<br />  </pre>\r\n<p>(You may need to replace the filenames as needed.)</p>\r\n<p>Then make "mypasswd" available to your non-root user account that\r\nyou will run John under. No further commands will need to be run as\r\nroot.</p>\r\n<p>If your system is ancient enough that it keeps passwords right in\r\nthe world-readable /etc/passwd, simply make a copy of that file.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now, let''s assume you''ve got a password file, "mypasswd", and want\r\nto crack it. The simplest way is to let John use its default order of\r\ncracking modes:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<pre> john mypasswd</pre>\r\n<p>If no mode is specified, john will try "single" first,\r\nthen "wordlist" and finally "incremental". Once John finds a password,\r\nit will be printed to the terminal and saved into a file called\r\n/john.pot. John will read this file when it restarts so it doesn''t try\r\nto crack already done passwords. To see the cracked passwords, use john\r\n-show mypasswd Important: do this under the same directory where the\r\npassword was cracked (when using the cronjob, /var/lib/john), otherwise\r\nit won''t work. While cracking, you can press any key for status, or\r\nCtrl+C to abort the session, saving point information to a file (\r\n/restore by default). By the way, if you press Ctrl+C twice John will\r\nabort immediately without saving. The point information is also saved\r\nevery 10 minutes (configurable in the configuration file, /john.ini )\r\nin case of a crash. To continue an interrupted session, run: john\r\n-restore</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span class="mw-headline">Options </span></h2>\r\n<p>All the options recognized by john start with a single dash (`-''). A summary of options is included below.</p>\r\n<p>-external:MODE\r\nEnables an external mode, using external functions defined in /john.ini''s [List.External:MODE] section.</p>\r\n<p>-format:NAME\r\nAllows you to override the ciphertext format detection. Currently,\r\nvalid format names are DES, BSDI, MD5, BF, AFS, LM. You can use this\r\noption when cracking or with ''-test''. Note that John can''t crack\r\npassword files with different ciphertext formats at the same time.</p>\r\n<p>-groups:[-]GID[,..]\r\nTells John to load users of the specified group(s) only.</p>\r\n<p>-incremental[:MODE]\r\nEnables the incremental mode, using the specified /john.ini definition\r\n(section [Incremental:MODE], or [Incremental:All] by default).</p>\r\n<p>-makechars:FILE\r\nGenerates a charset file, based on character frequencies from\r\n/john.pot, for use with the incremental mode. The entire /john.pot will\r\nbe used for the charset file unless you specify some password files.\r\nYou can also use an external filter() routine with this option.</p>\r\n<p>-restore[:FILE]\r\nContinues an interrupted cracking session, reading point information from the specified file ( /restore by default).</p>\r\n<p>-rules\r\nEnables wordlist rules, that are read from [List.Rules:Wordlist].</p>\r\n<p>-salts:[-]COUNT\r\nThis feature sometimes allows to achieve better performance. For\r\nexample you can crack only some salts using ''-salts:2'' faster, and then\r\ncrack the rest using ''-salts:-2''. Total cracking time will be about the\r\nsame, but you will get some passwords cracked earlier.</p>\r\n<p>-savemem:LEVEL\r\nYou might need this option if you don''t have enough memory, or don''t\r\nwant John to affect other processes too much. Level 1 tells John not to\r\nwaste memory on login names, so you won''t see them while cracking.\r\nHigher levels have a performance impact: you should probably avoid\r\nusing them unless John doesn''t work or gets into swap otherwise.</p>\r\n<p>-session:FILE\r\nAllows you to specify another point information file''s name to use for\r\nthis cracking session. This is useful for running multiple instances of\r\nJohn in parallel, or just to be able to recover an older session later,\r\nnot always continue the latest one.</p>\r\n<p>-shells:[-]SHELL[,..]\r\nThis option is useful to load accounts with a valid shell only, or not\r\nto load accounts with a bad shell. You can omit the path before a shell\r\nname, so ''-shells:csh'' will match both ''/bin/csh'' and ''/usr/bin/csh'',\r\nwhile - shells:/bin/csh'' will only match ''/bin/csh''.</p>\r\n<p>-show\r\nThis is the most powerful mode. John will try any character combination\r\nto resolve the password. Details about these modes can be found in the\r\nMODES file in john''s documentation, including how to define your own\r\ncracking methods.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><span class="mw-headline">Files </span></h2>\r\n<p>/etc/john/john.conf\r\nis where you configure how john will behave.</p>\r\n<p>/etc/john/john-mail.msg\r\nhas the message sent to users when their paswords are successfully cracked.</p>\r\n<p>/etc/john/john-mail.conf\r\nis used to configure how john will send messages to users that had their passwords cracked.</p>', '', 1, 1, 0, 25, '', '2008-10-20 14:42:25', '2008-10-20 14:59:57');
